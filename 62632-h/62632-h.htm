<p class="intro">
"The flowering of civilisation is the finished man, the man of
sense, of grace, of accomplishment, of social power&mdash;the
gentleman.  What hinders that he be born here?  The new times need
a new man, the complemental man, whom plainly this country
must furnish....  Of no use are the men who study to do
exactly as was done before, who can never understand that to-day
is a new day."&mdash;EMERSON.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Against a background of bewilderingly varied
activities which projects from the earliest years of
the sixteenth well into the twentieth century and
reveals itself as a moving panorama of explorers,
pioneers, adventurers, traders, and missionaries,
there stands out a line of remarkable personalities
whose latter-day leadership has largely
initiated as well as dominated the conditions of
their time and the bequest of century to century.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
Among these were men, lofty of soul and tenacious
of high purpose, who saw the potential Empire in
a vast and infinitely varied region which seemed
compact of unrelated resources.  They were kindled
by the growing achievements of the constructive
genius that had already projected the wonderful
steel highways carrying civilisation into the
trackless wilderness.  This constructive genius bridged
the mighty rivers; created extensive waterways
by means of canals connecting lakes and flowing
streams; in still later years this genius commanded
the cataracts and rapids to transform their
ceaseless motion into motor power for traction, and
lighting, and other service of industrial and economic
value.
</p>

<p>
Each successive civilisation of the world, indeed,
has shown an unbroken line of exceptional
personalities in whom has been focussed the power of
their epoch.  They are the centres through which
this power becomes manifest in applied purposes
and special achievements.  Civilisation itself is but
the evolutionary representation of successive
conditions of increasing enlightenment.  With each
succeeding age does man recognise more and more
clearly his relation to the moral order of the
universe.  The guidance of unseen destiny leads him
on, and in the records of no country is this working
out of the invisible design more unmistakably
shown than in those of the Dominion of Canada.
This golden thread discloses itself to retrospective
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
scrutiny through a period of three centuries of time.
"Man imagines and arranges his plans," says
Leblond de Brumath in his biography of Bishop
Laval; "but above these arrangements hovers
Providence whose foreseeing sets all in order for
the accomplishment of His impenetrable design....
Nor must man banish God from history, for
then would everything become incomprehensible
and inexplicable."
</p>

<p>
The creative forces of an Empire include various
and varying agencies.  If to the courage and heroism
of the original discoverers of the land too great
recognition can hardly be given, yet to those who
have made these discoveries of value by bringing
the resources of a continent into useful relations
with humanity recognition is not less due.  John
and Sebastian Cabot, Jacques Cartier, Champlain,
Mackenzie, Fraser, and La Salle, were great pathfinders.
But the very greatness of their achievements
required such men as James McGill, Donald Smith
(Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal), Sir George
Etienne Cartier, the Right Honourable Sir John
Alexander Macdonald, Sir Charles Tupper, and
others, to stamp the early life of the pioneer with
the seal of statesmanship and education.  Here were
vast areas of land; enchanting rivers, noble lakes,
majestic mountains; untold wealth in minerals and
in the boundless potentialities of agriculture; a
marvellous country that is not only a land of
promise, but a veritable Promised Land.  Yet are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
its possibilities like those of the ether of space, until
it is rendered accessible to restless, struggling
humanity by the indomitable power of great spirits,
of wise and forcible leaders of progress who are
perhaps the pioneers of the physical world in a
degree similar to that of lofty beings in the realms
unseen.  It is such as they who create the conditions
which render all these immeasurable resources of
practical value to humanity.  Such men as Sir
William Cornelius Van Horne and Charles Melville
Hays; men who have courage as well as vision;
who see beyond all barriers; men who dare do that
which weaker souls fear to attempt&mdash;such men are
as truly among the creative forces of their country
as are its original discoverers.

<p>
Little reference to these earliest years of Canadian
history could be made, even in the mere outline
which alone is possible in these pages, without a
vivid recognition of episode and adventure so
startling, so often brilliant and romantic, so often
tragic in its heroic endurance and ultimate fatality
as to illuminate the horizon of history with a flame
not unlike the dazzling lights in Polar skies.  There
were miracle hours that condensed experiences as
significant as those often diffused throughout an
entire cycle of time.  Mingled with these were the
long, slow periods of patient labour.  It is not with
sudden leaps and bounds alone that life progresses,
but by the steady, normal advance of persistent
endeavour.  Nor can demands for improved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
conditions be always unmingled with some measure of
judicious compromise.  James Mill, referring to his
experiences while in the London office, engaged with
the affairs of India, says: "I learnt how to obtain
the best I could when I could not obtain everything.
Instead of being indignant or dispirited because I
could not entirely have my own way, to be pleased
and encouraged when I could have the smallest
part of it; and when that could not be, to bear with
complete equanimity the being over-ruled
altogether."  Something of this philosophy the makers
of Canada were compelled to accept.  The incomers
from France, the incomers from Great Britain,
represented two distinct, even if not unfriendly
nations.  There were differences of race, of language,
of creed.  There were differing convictions as to
institutions and laws.  Until the Confederation the
interests of the people were largely local rather than
united.  The unifying of a country of such enormous
geographical extent and including such vital
differences among its widely scattered inhabitants, must
always prefigure itself as one of the signal feats in
the statesmanship of the world.
</p>

<p>
The very magnitude of the resources and the
infinite riches of Canada presented themselves in
the guise of difficulties and obstacles to be
conquered.  Nature provided the vast systems of lakes
and rivers; but these required vast schemes of
engineering construction to render them of fullest
service as continuous waterways.  The broad rivers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
must be bridged.  Triumphs of construction have
arisen, such as the Victoria Jubilee Bridge across
the St. Lawrence at Montreal, a marvellous feat of
engineering, and the splendid steel arch bridge over
the Gorge of Niagara.  Again, in the interests of
transcontinental transit, the mountain ranges,
whose peaks seem to pierce the sky, must be
overcome.  Unmapped tracts of almost impenetrable
forests; wastes of rocks, and swamps, and the
treacherous muskeg; or immense plains, still
inhospitable to the destined tide of settlers, must
all be subdued in the interests of the advancing
civilisation and the development of a country
bordering upon three oceans with an extent of
coast-line exceeding that of any other country in
the world.  Then there were incalculable mining
possibilities, precious metals, copper, iron, coal;
there were unlimited resources of lumber, but the
trees must be felled, and there must be railways
or waterways to transport the timber.  Canada
offered water-power enough to turn the wheels of all
the manufactories of Europe, but this power was
useless until harnessed by the constructive genius of
man.  Another valuable asset was the pulpwood,
the vastness of which suggested this country as the
very centre of the pulp and paper manufacturing
industry; but between the thousands of acres covered
with white spruce trees, and the lakes and rivers
contiguous ready to furnish the power, what marvels
of mechanism must be duly constructed to bring
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
the pulpwood and the water-power into service of
man.  As an indication of the proportions to which
this industry has already grown it may be cited that
for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 1916, the
Canadian pulp print papermakers shipped to the
United States alone seven hundred and ninety-four
and a half millions of pounds, an increase of one
hundred and eighty millions over the amount
shipped to the States in the preceding year.
</p>

<p>
Here, indeed, was a country rivalling any other
in the world in the largess of nature, but whose
every aspect was a challenge to the constructive
enterprise of man.  Nature, with unsurpassed
lavishness, presented the raw material; it rested
with man to stamp it with value.  Thus the stimulus
to industrial and commercial activities was second
to none other in the history of nations.
</p>

<p>
These were the conditions that confronted, as well
as rewarded, the early discoverers and pioneers.
Did some prescience of all this potential wealth
awaiting the centuries to come drift across the
ocean spaces and touch minds sensitive to its
impress?
</p>

John and Sebastian Cabot were impelled by a
destiny as unrevealed to them as was that of
Columbus.  Each bore a magic mirror turned forward
to reflect the promise of the future.  In the hand of
each was carried the lighted torch.  It was passed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
from each explorer to his successor.  Cartier, who
navigated the St. Lawrence to Quebec and then on
to Hochelaga (the name given to the primitive
Indian village on the site of which now stands the
stately and splendid city of Montreal), carried the
lighted torch still farther, and passed it on to
Champlain who, three-quarters of a century later,
came to found a trading-post on the island of
Montreal&mdash;"La Place Royale" it was then called,
the picturesque mountain that rises in the midst
of the modern city of to-day having been named
by Cartier "Mont Royale," from which is derived
the present Montreal.  There followed La Salle,
Marquette, Joliet, and others.  Sieur de Maisonneuve
consecrated the site of Montreal as the first act of his
landing.  It is little wonder that the visitor to this
entrancing city to-day feels some unanalysed and
mystic touch pervading the air, something that
must forever haunt and pervade his memories of
stately, magnificent Montreal.  No other city on the
continent has this indefinable element of magic and
of charm.

The seventeenth century was an almost unbroken
period of bold and daring adventure and of
missionary activities.  All over the world, at this time,
was there manifested the passion for exploration.
It prevailed over the entire continent of Europe.  It
recorded its progress on the new continent of North
America.
</p>

<p>
The discovery of Hudson Bay has been placed by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
some statisticians as early as 1498, when it is
surmised that Cabot may have reached it; but the
absolute and authentic date still lingers somewhat in
the region of conjecture and mystery.  It was in 1607
that Henry Hudson is known to have first seen it as
he sailed in search of the North Pole.  Intrepid
adventurer!  He found, not the goal of his quest,
but, instead, that "undiscovered country" we shall
all one day see.  "Hudson's shallop went down in as
utter silence and mystery as that which surrounds
the watery graves of those old sea Vikings who rode
out to meet death on the billow," says a Canadian
historian.  Hudson Bay became a centre of intense
interest to all the exploring navigators.  Admiral
Sir Thomas Button sailed in search of Hudson, or
of some tidings of his fate.  He returned without
the knowledge he sought for, but with much information
regarding all the western coast.  Still later came
Foxe and James.  In 1631 Foxe discovered a fallen
cross which he judged had been erected by his
predecessor, the English Admiral, and he raised it and
affixed an inscription and the date.
</p>

<p>
An organisation that was pre-eminently one of
the creative forces of Canada was that of the
Hudson's Bay Company, which traces its origin to
a voyage of adventure made by two Frenchmen,
Pierre Esprit de Radisson and Menart Chouart
sieur Degroseillers, who were allured by rumours
of the "inexhaustible harvest of furs" that awaited
enterprising traders.  Baffled for the time by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
obstacles that seemed insurmountable, they returned
to England to ask the assistance of King Charles II.,
and in 1666 was formed a company that included
Prince Rupert (a cousin of the king), the Duke of
Albemarle, the Earl of Craven, Sir George Carteret,
and other noblemen and merchants, as the
incorporators, to whom, in 1670, the king granted a
charter to comprise "the whole trade of all the
seas, bays, rivers, and sounds, in whatever latitude,
... and territories of the coasts which are not
now actually possessed by any of our subjects, or
by the subjects of any other Christian prince or
state."  In the following year two vessels were sent
out within a short period and there sprang up a
group of trading posts.  Radisson remained for life
in the service of the Company.
</p>

<p>
Against the living background of Canadian history
in all its varied activities, no one contributing
factor stands out with such prominence as that of
this Hudson's Bay Company which, for two and a
half centuries, dominated the country and whose
commercial importance played so large a part in her
development.  Let no one mistake the purpose of
the Company, however, as one inspired by purely
philanthropic or patriotic ardour.  The dominant
aim was by no means primarily that of the
development of the new and almost unknown country.
The servants of the Company were not braving the
terrors and hardships of the wilderness on exclusively
altruistic inspirations.  On the contrary, it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
their policy to conceal the existence of the vast
riches of the land and to represent it as inaccessible
to any one beyond Indians and hunters.  Even as
late as the comparatively recent date of the decade
of 1860-70, the pupils in Canadian schools were
taught that all the Hudson Bay region was
uninhabitable; that it was a desolate "No Man's Land,"
so to speak, covered with ice and snow.  No effort
to change this impression was made by those
concerned with the administration of the Company, but,
rather, they were more or less untiring in assisting
to confirm it.  They had their occult reasons for not
being averse to the representation of the entire
North-West as being quite valueless for the purposes
of civilisation.  The impression, if not the conviction,
was well authorised that the climate rendered the
region quite impossible for habitation; and the
region in which now lies the most wonderful wheat-growing
belt of the world, and whose fertility under
cultivation renders it capable of supporting a
population as large as that of the entire United States
at the present time (estimated at one hundred
millions), was assumed to be a region only capable
of sustaining wild animals, Indians, and the most
hardy hunters and traders.  Now it is traversed
by three transcontinental railways which have
opened an immense business of travel and traffic;
and beside dozens of prosperous young towns
and villages it contains Winnipeg with its quarter
of a million people; Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
Regina; the important new terminal seaport of
Prince Rupert, and the still older and more
developed port of Vancouver; to say nothing of the
scenic grandeur through all the Mount Robson
locale, that has captured the enthusiasm of the
world.  The tradition of the rigours of climate
has become so popularised that even as late as
the summer of 1915 a New England tourist faring
forth for a trip through the great North-West
of Canada was urged to provide himself with
furs and rugs enough to fit out an expedition
to the Polar regions.  As a matter of fact the only
embarrassment encountered as to temperature was
that of trying to discover sufficiently thin clothing
for Winnipeg in the opening September days, where
the sunshine poured down just then with a flood of
radiance that fairly rivalled that of a summer in the
Capital city of the United States.  Yet, even in all
this splendour of sunshine and discomfort of heat,
that wonderful quality of the Canadian air was not
wanting&mdash;a peculiar invigoration which one who
has visited the Dominion misses for a long time
after leaving the country.  Edmonton repeated the
same wonderful luxuriance with the same delicious
coolness at night; and the journey on through the
magnificent mountain scenery to Prince Rupert
had the exquisite temperature of an Italian
spring.
</p>

<p>
The Hudson's Bay Company, however, was not
organised on the basis of a bureau of publicity for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
the general benefit of the country and of posterity.
Their aim was the gaining of wealth and it was one
signally successful.  Immense quantities of valuable
furs were shipped homeward every year; the shares
in the Company became more and more valuable
as magnificent dividends were continually declared.
They controlled a territory exceeding an area of
two million square miles.  It was peopled only by
the Indians.  Yet all through the seventeenth
century run the records of that self-sacrificing and
heroic band, the Jesuit missionaries, whose devotion
to the Christian ideal led them on with a faith and
fervour that consecrates their memory.

The ambition of the Company to extend their
trading posts still farther and farther inland incited
still more explorations into the unknown North-West.
They builded better than they knew, for while their
aim hardly went beyond that of increasing their own
revenues, the results were inevitable factors in the
development of the country.  That this is true is not
in any wise, as has already been said, to be regarded
as in the nature of philanthropic or patriotic zeal.
They regarded the country and its wealth in the
light of a personal perquisite for their exploiting
and financial benefit.  They circulated the
information that this was a "Great Lone Land," as
undesirable as it was inaccessible.  From motives of
self-interest, if not entirely those of humanity, the
Company had treated the Indians with kindness and
justice and had thus made the British flag something
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
to be held in respect by the tribes.  Thus they had
built up a strong reliance for themselves of
friendliness on the part of the dusky natives.  One of the
eminent historians, George Bancroft, of Boston,
U.S.A., calls attention to this attitude of the
Hudson's Bay Company, saying that both the
officers and the servants of the corporation "were
as much gentlemen by instinct in their treatment
of the Indians as in their treatment of civilised men
and women."  Thus, whenever they should wish to
exclude, as enemies, those who came among them
representing any other enterprise, they had strong
supporters and coadjutors among the tribes.  "No
trespassers allowed" was practically their motto.
Explorations, or the extension of trade, were alike
vigilantly discouraged.  "Notwithstanding the
efforts put forth by the Company," says one
chronicle, "it was realised that unless the active
co-operation of the Indians could be secured, white
trespassers would inevitably make inroads into the
trade of the Territory.  Steps were therefore taken
to unite the tribes against all whites not officially
connected with the Company.  The means adopted
were worthy of the object desired, but could only
have been the outcome of an extraordinary disregard
of the ordinary amenities of life.  The Indians
were told that these outsiders would rob and cheat
them in the barter of their furs."  Still, the very
prominence of the Company was its own enormous
and inevitable advertisement, so to speak, of untold
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
resources connected with the mysterious regions, and
both trade and further exploration were stimulated.
</p>

<p>
The first quarter of the eighteenth century had
but just passed when (in 1727) Pierre Gaultier de
Varennes (Sieur de la Verendrye), who was stationed
on Lake Nipigon, became imbued with ardour
regarding the great question of the day, the North-West
Passage; and in 1731 he, with his three sons
and an armed force of about fifty men, left Montreal
for the West, reaching the shores of Lake Superior
within two months, and pushing on&mdash;trading and
exploring meanwhile&mdash;through the all but impenetrable
wilderness until he sailed up the Red River,
and in the autumn of 1738 established a fort near
the site now occupied by the city of Winnipeg.
</p>

<p>
The great profits accruing to the Hudson's Bay
Company inspired rivalry, and in 1795 its keen
competitor, the North-West Company, was formed
under the leadership of Simon M'Tavish, a Scottish
Highlander, of "enormous energy and decision of
character."  Still another company came into being,
organised by two merchants of Montreal, John
Gregory and Alexander Norman McLeod, which
during its brief life was known as the X Y Company,
to whose purposes was attracted a young Scotsman
who was destined to be immortalised by his remarkable
explorations and his discovery of the great river
which perpetuates his name.  This young man was
Alexander Mackenzie, who came to Canada in 1779,
and immediately entered the fur trade.  He became
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
connected with the North-West Company and the
X Y Company and left for the west to take charge
of the Churchill River district.  Later, owing to
personal dissensions and conflicts of the Company
with another of its agents, Mackenzie was commissioned
to the Athabasca district, and it was there,
apparently, that his project of exploration to the
Arctic Ocean took possession of him.  From the
Indians he heard traditions of a mighty river like
that of the Saskatchewan, and in June 1789 he had
crossed Athabasca Lake and reached the Peace
River which "displayed a succession of the most
beautiful scenery," as he recorded.  He journeyed
to Great Slave Lake after encountering immense
difficulties&mdash;rapids, long portages, boiling caldrons,
and treacherous eddies that threatened to engulf
his barque; but at the end of the month he found
himself on the river that now bears his name, and
on the 12th of July he first sighted the Arctic
Ocean.  Then there intervened a visit to England
before his second expedition in 1792.  His memorable
inscription on a rock, on the coast near Vancouver:
"Alexander Mackenzie from Canada by land,
22 July, 1793," tells its own story.  It is not, however,
with the long-familiar details of his expeditions
that we are here concerned, but with the recognition
of their result as one of the constructive factors of
the Dominion.  The story of these undertakings, of
the adventurous journeys of the many explorers,
inclusive of Hudson, La Verendrye, Mackenzie,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
Henry, Thompson, Fraser, Franklin, is a part of
the story of Canada.  To trace out the contributing
causes and the influences investing each of these
would be to throw a new illumination on the
inter-relations of the factors that have sprung into
activity over a long series of years as involved in
the evolution of a wonderful country whose great
destiny impresses the civilised world.

The opening years of the nineteenth century were
marked by a noble project that apparently ended
in failure at the time and yet whose significance is
not lost.  In every worthy purpose, cosmopolitan,
national, or individual in its scope, there is the germ
of vitality, and dying in one form it is resurrected
in another.  Truly of such purposes may be said,
in the sublime words of the apostle, that they are
"sown in weakness, but raised in power."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The good, though only thought, has life and breath."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Such a project was that of the Earl of Selkirk
to assist numbers of his poorer countrymen by
founding a colony for them in the Hudson Bay
Territory, where they should find homes and engage
in pleasant and profitable agricultural work.  With
Lord Selkirk it was not the dazzling opportunities
of the fur trade that impelled his journey, when, in
1815, he with Lady Selkirk and their son and two
daughters landed in Montreal, having already sent
out three parties of his country people to the tract
of land whose area was that of a hundred and ten
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
thousand square miles which he had purchased in
the Red River Valley.  His scheme for the betterment
of these people included free transportation
and temporary support for the settler until he could
begin to make his own way, together with a free
gift of the land.  It was in 1810 that Lord Selkirk had
matured his scheme and purchased the land; but on
arriving with his family he found himself assailed
with charges of conspiracy, condemned to the
payment of fines that he contended were totally
unjust, and confronted with a strange network of
alleged misrepresentation and accusation.  It would
seem that his chief desire was that of generous and
noble aid to his countrymen.  His experience is not
without its parallel pervading all history in the lives
of men whose single-hearted aim has been to make
the world a better place.  Who shall penetrate the
spiritual mystery in that he whose efforts are noble
and unselfish not infrequently confronts the same
results as might properly belong to him whose
objects were quite the reverse of these?  "And
that all this should have come to you who had
meant to lead a higher life than the common,
and to find out better ways," exclaims George
Eliot's Dorothea to Lydgate, in the great novel of
<i>Middlemarch</i>; and the heroine adds: "There is no
sorrow I have thought more about than that&mdash;to
love what is great and try to reach it and then fail."
</p>

<p>
Lord Selkirk took this experience greatly to heart.
However much to be regretted is the failure of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
sufficient courage and faith to enable one to stand
strong, "and having done all, still to stand," before
a flagrant injustice or the pain of misconception, it is
yet hardly to be wondered at that a sensitive spirit,
conscious of its own integrity and unmeasured
good-will, falters and faints before so unfortunate an
experience.  To the Scottish Earl it seems to have
been more than he could endure.  In 1818 he returned
to Scotland, and soon after died, at the early age
of forty-nine, in Pau, having gone to southern
France in search of renewed health.  The Red River
settlement that he founded was in the neighbourhood
of the present city of Winnipeg.
</p>

<p>
Historians differ, however, as to the motives of
Lord Selkirk, some authorities taking a view quite
opposite to the one cited here, and gathered, too,
from trustworthy sources.  The truth may lie
somewhere between the two extremes.  It is as unnecessary
as it would be futile to endeavour to invest
every leader of a movement with a golden halo like
that of the mediæval saints of the Quattrocentisti.
The world's progress has always been carried forward
by mixed forces and both ideas and institutions owe
their vitality to complex aims and to a variety of
conditions.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1821 the Hudson's Bay Company
and the North-West Companies united.  This marked
an epoch in Canadian progress; and in 1838 occurred
another event, unnoted as of any significance at the
time, yet which proved to be the advent of one of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
greatest of the creative forces of Canada.  "Any one
watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human
lots," says George Eliot, "sees a slow preparation
of effects from one life on another, which tells like a
calculated irony on the indifference or the frozen
stare with which we look at our unintroduced
neighbour.  Destiny stands by sarcastic with our
<i>dramatis personæ</i> folded in her hand."  Surely the
arrival at Montreal of a Scottish lad of seventeen
years of age could hardly be held as bearing any
direct relation to the future development and the
cosmopolitan importance of Canada.  Yet what a
romance of history lies between the unnoticed
landing of Donald A. Smith, in 1838, and the solemn
grandeur of the scene in Westminster Abbey, in
January of 1914, when representatives of the Crown,
with the peers, the statesmen, the scholars, the
social leaders of London; with a great concourse
drawn from all ranks, met for the memorial service
for Donald Alexander Smith, first Baron Strathcona
and Mount Royal.  "The memory of ten centuries
of England's illustrious dead haunted the scene."
</p>

<p>
Donald Smith crossed the Atlantic in a small
supply craft belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company
and took up his duties as a clerk in one of the
most unimportant branches of the service.  He made
the 1200 miles' journey from Montreal to Labrador.
He was stationed in a place where only once a year
could any tidings reach him from the outside world.
Was he lonely in this exile?  He himself said that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
never knew what the feeling of loneliness was.  He
had books; he had thoughts.  Such a psychologist
as the late William James, who to his profound
grasp of psychology and philosophy added the
unmapped power of spiritual divination, would have
found, in these long, solitary years of meditation
and thought, the key and clue to the lad's future
greatness.  In the infinite and unmeasured force
generated by thought-vibrations lies power that
may transcend a universe.  "Mind with will is
intelligent energy," declares a recent scientific
writer, who adds: "intelligent energy is enough to
supply a cause for every known effect within the
limits of the universe."
</p>

<p>
Sir Oliver Lodge has recently said that life is
simply "utilised and guided energy to produce
results which otherwise would not have happened."  If
the distinguished British scientist had been
seeking a phrase to define the life of Donald
Alexander Smith he could hardly have created one more
felicitous.  That the results that were called into
activity for a period of over fifty years, of
momentous importance to Canada, by the causes set up by
the young Scotsman, matters that would never have
happened but for him, is evident to all who study
closely the modern history of the Dominion.  Lord
Strathcona's biographer, Mr. Beckles Willson,
introduces the reader to a long record of interesting
details of the early years of Donald Smith, all of
which contributed to the development and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
nurture of the marvellous qualities which rendered
him one of the most determining of the forces that
shaped the destiny of Canada.  The brilliant John
Jay Chapman, writing of the remarkable man who
may be said to have initiated the abolition of slavery
in the United States, remarks of his subject:
"Garrison plunged through the icy atmosphere like a
burning meteorite from another planet."  Not thus,
however, did Donald Smith enter on his great career.
Exiled in a far and frozen region, his service in
Labrador lasted for thirteen years "with no
companionship save a few employees and his own
thoughts, learning the secrets of the Company, how
to manage the Indians, and how to produce the best
returns."[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]  Thirty years had passed since his landing
in Canada when, in 1868, on the death of Governor
Simpson, of the Hudson's Bay Company, whose
office was in Montreal, Mr. Smith was appointed by
the London office to succeed him.  He was then in
his forty-ninth year.  Born on August 6, 1820, he
died on January 21, 1914, in his ninety-fourth year.
The forty-five years which preceded his passing from
the physical realm were the years in which Canada
entered on her great destiny, and of this momentous
period Lord Strathcona might well have said, "All
of which I saw and part of which I was."  His
devotion and loyalty to the Empire was as intelligent
and wise as it was ardent and powerful.  The history
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
of Canada and his personal biography during those
years might almost be interchangeable terms.  The
Hudson's Bay Company, although organised and
conducted on a financial basis, was the soul of
loyalty to the Empire.  The splendid courage,
endurance, and persistence that characterised its
entire tenure entered into the very structure of the
nation.

<p>
About the middle of the nineteenth century a man
who has been termed "an uncrowned king" by some
of the more enthusiastic, if not more discriminating
of his followers; a man who was, at all events,
an influential political leader and who especially
espoused the cause of Upper Canada, opened a
crusade for the acquisition on the part of the
government of all the territorial rights of the
Hudson's Bay Company.  This man was George
Brown, the founder and at that time the editor of
the Toronto <i>Globe</i>.  He was a member of Parliament,
and he was also one of the band of great editors in
which the journalism of that period found its most
potent expression.  This order of editorial influence
was represented in the United States by Horace
Greeley of the New York <i>Tribune</i>; Charles A. Dana
of the New York <i>Sun</i>; and Samuel Bowles of the
Springfield (Massachusetts) <i>Republican</i>, whose spirit
and influence continue to manifest themselves in the
high quality of that journal to-day.  This dominant
editorial influence still survives in the States, in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
personality of the brilliant and splendidly-endowed
Colonel Henry Watterson, the proprietor and editor
of the Louisville (Kentucky) <i>Courier-Journal</i>, and
it was evident in the New York <i>Evening Post</i>, under
the conduct of Horace White, whose death (in
September, 1916) was a signal loss to the American
press.
</p>

<p>
There is ample authority for the assertion that
George Brown's newspaper "had an influence on
the populace such as no other had in Canada."  It
was under his administration of the Toronto <i>Globe</i>
that this journal issued its first bugle call regarding
the desirability that Canada should possess herself
of all the wide sweep of the Hudson Bay territory of
the west.  This demand aroused from the Company
a storm of emphatic declarations that the "Great
Lone Land" was not worth the acquisition of the
state; that its climate and its conditions rendered
it forever useless to the interests of civilisation.
Through nearly two decades had this agitation
continued; but in 1869 the Government purchased
the vast holdings of the Company at the price of
three hundred thousand pounds and the further
grant of one-twentieth of the fertile belt of land, and
of forty-five thousand acres in addition adjoining
various trading-posts.  This transaction threw all
the North-West into an excited state and Governor
MacDougall was sent out to Fort Garry to still the
commotion.  Then came on the Rebellion incited
and led by Louis Riel, the story of which is so familiar
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
to all readers of Canadian history.  The conditions
became disastrous and alarming, and Governor
MacDougall was not permitted to move on to his
appointed post.  Under these circumstances Donald
A. Smith decided to go immediately to the Red River
country.  He was not the man to hesitate when he
heard the call of duty.  He was at once invested with
the authority of Commissioner by the Dominion
Government, and the story of his success, and of
the end of the first rebellion under Louis Riel, is too
well known to require extended allusion.  Soon after
this Mr. Smith was elected to Parliament as the first
representative from Manitoba.  It was to his astute
knowledge, his skill as a tactician, the great
confidence that he inspired, and to his ability as a
Parliamentarian that the successful settlement of the
affairs between the Government and the Hudson's
Bay Company was primarily due.  Meantime the
problem of the consolidation of the Provinces
became more evident as one that focussed the
interest of the time.  The epoch-making solution of
this problem came in 1867 when the Dominion was
formed.
</p>

<p>
Canada was fortunate at this critical time in
having a Premier of remarkable qualities, who was
the man for the hour.  John Alexander Macdonald
(afterwards knighted and invested with the honour
of a Grand Cross of the Bath) was a Scotsman by
birth whose family removed to Canada in his early
childhood.  With the sturdy qualities of his race he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
thus united the influences of Canadian environment
and training, the family arriving in Canada in 1820,
when the future Prime Minister was but five years
of age.  In his earliest youth, as a lad of fifteen,
circumstances forced him into the world to earn his
living.  Life itself became his university.  He
developed in his first contact with the world that
initiative, that instant perception of the situation and
the facility to meet it, which so signally distinguished
his statesmanship in after years.  The family had
landed at Quebec and journeyed to Kingston where
they settled and lived until the death of the elder
Macdonald in 1841, leaving the household in
straitened circumstances.  The Ontario of those
days was very different from the smiling and
prosperous Province of the present time.  All Upper
Canada (as it was then known) was covered with
dense forests, and all means of transportation were
primitive and slow.  "Railways, of course, were
unknown," writes Sir Joseph Pope, the authorised
biographer of Sir John Alexander Macdonald,
"and macadamised roads, then looked upon as
great luxuries, were few and far between.  The
climate, too, was more severe than, owing to the
cultivation of the soil, it has since become."  In
1842, at the age of twenty-seven, Macdonald made
his first visit to England, largely for the purpose
of purchasing his law library.  Quoting a letter
written by him at this time to his mother, his
biographer (Sir Joseph Pope) adds:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Forty-two years passed away and again John Alexander
Macdonald stood within the portals of Windsor Castle;
but under what different circumstances!  No longer an
unknown visitor, peeping with youthful curiosity through
half-open doors; but as the First Minister of a mighty
Dominion, he comes by the Queen's command to dine at
her table, and, in the presence of the Prime Minister and
of one of the great nobles of England, who alone have been
summoned as witnesses of the ceremony, to receive from
the hand of his Sovereign that token and pledge of her
regard which, as such, he greatly prized&mdash;the broad, red
riband of the Bath."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
An omnivorous reader and endowed with a
winning and impressive personality, Macdonald at
once became a significant and an influential figure
in Canadian life.  Among the creative forces of his
adopted and beloved country he holds a place never
to be forgotten.  He first took his seat in the Assembly
of 1844; the new Parliament met in Montreal in
the November of that year.  Complex problems
confronted the sessions of that period, in that
Canada felt she had no potential voice in the
administration of affairs.  Every measure of the
Assembly must secure the approval of the Legislative
Council, the members of which were appointed
for life by the governor-general, and added to this
the measure must then receive the royal assent
before it became operative.  The conditions were
also aggravated by the large majority of Canadians
of French descent, sensitive and high-spirited, who
rebelled against the invariable English rule of an
English governor-general.  These questions and
other agitations made the political life on which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
the young member entered one of peculiar intricacy.
The Canada of that day was one of undeveloped
resources and of internal dissensions.  It consisted
only of those territories which we know as the
Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island were in
the same position politically as Newfoundland is in
to-day, while the North-West provinces were a
wilderness.  With Macdonald's rise to prominence
in the political world the idea of confederation
began to engage the attention of all those who had
at heart the good of the country.  The far-seeing
leader of the conservative party began a campaign
for the confederation of Quebec and Ontario with
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward
Island, believing that the best course was to bring
about this preliminary union, leaving it open to
extension if time and experience should prove it to
be desirable.  Owing to the closeness of party
divisions, successive governments vainly attempted to
carry on the work of the country.  It was a critical
period, and the manner in which a solution for the
national troubles was found will remain one of the
most striking episodes in the history of the times.
</p>

<p>
Sir John Carling was the means of bringing
together the conflicting elements.  He was a power
in the affairs of Ontario and an enthusiastic
supporter of Macdonald, while he also enjoyed the
friendship of the Honourable George Brown, who
was recognised as the Liberal leader of Upper
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
Canada, and who, for many years, had been the
opponent of Macdonald.  But the veiled and
shrouded figure of Destiny hovered near.  Did she
bear a magic wand, concealed but potent?  At all
events she ordained that Brown and Carling should
journey together from Toronto to Quebec on their
way to attend a meeting of the Legislative Council.
In their discussion of public affairs George Brown
remarked: "Macdonald has the chance of his life
to do great things for his country and these can only
be done by carrying confederation."  To this Sir
John rejoined: "But you would be the first to
oppose him."  To Carling's surprise Brown replied:
"No, I should uphold him as I feel that confederation
is the only thing for the country."  What a significant
moment was this in the history of the future
Dominion!  Forces, determining but unseen, were in the
air.  The finely-balanced mind of Sir John Carling
instantly grasped the importance of this
psychological moment.  "Would you mind saying to John
A. Macdonald what you have just told me?"
eagerly asked Sir John.  "Certainly not," replied
George Brown, and his companion lost no time in
bringing the two leaders together.  The result is well
known to all; the coalition ministry was framed and
carried to a successful conclusion the great task
with which it had been entrusted.
</p>

<p>
From that time until his death on June 6, 1891,
the energy, the genius, the influence of John
Alexander Macdonald were among the most potent of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
the creative forces of Canada, and for the proud
position that the Dominion holds to-day she is
largely indebted to this great leader.  One of the
most important of his powers for national service lay
in his ability to co-operate with strong men.  When
the movement for confederation was initiated the
situation was extremely critical, and it was to the
personal influence of the eminent French-Canadian,
George Etienne Cartier (who was born in
St. Antoine, Quebec, in 1814 and who died in 1873),
that the support of a reluctant Province was won
for the unification of Canada.  Cartier was educated
at the Seminary of St. Sulpice, Montreal; he was
called to the bar, and as a follower of Papineau he
fought against the Crown in 1837, and for some time
after sought refuge in the United States.  On the
restoration of peace he returned to Canada and
resumed his practice of law, attaining a high position,
and subsequently he became the attorney for the
Grand Trunk Railway.  He was elected to Parliament
in 1848 as the recognised leader of the
French-Canadians and when, in November of 1857, John
Alexander Macdonald succeeded Colonel Taché
as Premier of the Province of Canada, Cartier was
invited to a place in his cabinet.  Later he was
created a baronet of the British Empire.  From
1858 to 1862 the Cartier-Macdonald ministry held
its onward course, though steering its way through
quicksands and tumult.
</p>

<p>
To Sir George Etienne Cartier is ascribed valuable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
aid in the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway
and the Victoria Bridge, important influence in the
promotion of education, and signal service in
bettering the laws of Canada.  When, in 1885, a statue
to his honour was unveiled in Ottawa, Sir John
Macdonald in his address said of him: "He served
his country faithfully and well....  I believe no
public man has retained, during the whole of his
life, in so eminent a degree, the respect of both the
parties into which this great country is divided....
If he had done nothing else but give to Quebec the
most perfect code of law that exists in the entire
world, that was enough to make him immortal...."  To
Lord Lisgar the Premier wrote of Cartier: "We
have acted together since 1854 and never had a
serious difference.  He was as bold as a lion, and but
for him confederation could not have been carried."
</p>

<p>
Another of the strong forces in constructive
statesmanship was Sir Charles Tupper, who, almost
unaided, engaged in the great struggle to overcome
the opposition of Nova Scotia, his own Province,
to the scheme of confederation.  In this famous
group of colleagues, Sir John Alexander Macdonald,
Sir George Etienne Cartier, Sir Charles Tupper, and
the Honourable George Brown, conspicuous ability
and wonderful directive power were united with
an optimistic courage, a depth of conviction in the
success of important measures for the country, that
rendered them practically invincible among the
creative forces of Canada.  Nor could any mention
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
of this progress be complete that did not include the
name of Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley, many years
Minister of Finance, a worker for confederation,
whose own distinction of character and tenacity
of purpose determined the attitude taken by his
Province of New Brunswick in her wavering and
tardy decision, only crystallised into adherence
by the patriotic zeal of Sir Leonard.  "It is perhaps
the highest of all tributes to the genius of
Macdonald," says George R. Parkin,[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>] "that he was able
to draw to his support a group of men of the weight
and worth of Cartier, Tupper, and Tilley, and retain
through a long series of years their loyal devotion
to him as a leader.  Each in his own way a
commanding personality, they were of one accord
in following Macdonald with unswerving fidelity
through all the vicissitudes of his fortune.  Along
with him they grasped and held tenaciously the
idea of a great and united Canada forming an integral
part of the Empire, and to that end devoted the
work of their lives."

An interesting and graphic picture is preserved,
in the literature of the time, of the visit of Sir John
Macdonald, in 1879, to Lord Beaconsfield at Hughenden.
He was received as Canada's most illustrious
citizen and leading statesman.  After dinner Lord
Beaconsfield conducted his guest to the smoking-room
at the top of the house which was hung with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
old portraits of former Premiers of England.  The
host and his Canadian guest exchanged fragments
of personal reminiscences and experiences, and Lord
Beaconsfield greatly interested Sir John by his
brilliant description of some of the notable
personalities whom, in former days, he had met at Lady
Blessington's, who had a matchless gift for drawing
around her the celebrities of her time.  In bidding
Sir John good-night, at the end of a long and
delightful evening, Lord Beaconsfield said: "You have
greatly interested me both in yourself and in Canada.
Come back next year and I will do anything you
ask me."  The next year duly came, but Beaconsfield
had passed away, and Gladstone was the Premier.
It was during this visit that the classics were
discussed somewhat at length between Beaconsfield
and his guest, the Premier of England dwelling, in
the most fascinating manner, upon the poets,
philosophers, and orators of Greece and of Rome.

For nearly fifty years the influence of Sir John
Macdonald was a very pillar of the Dominion.  He
represented a united Canada that forms so important
an integral part of the mighty British Empire.
Lord Lorne said of him that he was "the most
successful statesman of one of the most successful
of the younger nations."
</p>

<p>
On his death Canada paid him her highest honours.
Queen Victoria, most gracious of Royal sovereigns,
wrote a personal letter of condolence to Lady
Macdonald, and caused her to be elevated to the peerage
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
with the title of Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe.
An impressive memorial service for the dead
Premier was held in Westminster Abbey, and later
his bust was placed in St. Paul's and unveiled by
Lord Rosebery.  Almost every large city in the
Dominion is adorned with a statue of Sir John
Macdonald.
</p>

<p>
One of the most important services to Canada,
on the part of the Premier, had been his early
recognition of the immeasurable possibilities of the
North-West.  As early as in 1871 he saw that the
construction of a railway to the Pacific coast was a matter
absolutely essential to the Dominion for the development
of this portion of the country.  In April of that
year, while Sir John Macdonald was absent in
Washington (U.S.A.) attending the proceedings of
the Joint High Commission, Sir George Cartier
moved a resolution in Parliament for the construction
of such a road.  The resolution was supported
by Sir Alexander Galt and was carried.  Sir Hugh
Allan and Donald Smith had long held commercial
relations, and the extensive and accurate knowledge
of all this region that Mr. Smith had acquired was of
inestimable value to the project.  Into this intricate
problem attending the decision and the subsequent
fulfilment of it in the construction of the Canadian
Pacific Railway (completed on November 7, 1885)
entered a group of important and forceful men.
The magnitude of the work offers material for many
chapters of Canadian history.  Among this group
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
of dominant personalities stands out that of William
Cornelius Van Horne (afterwards knighted) and
who was particularly well characterised by James
Jerome Hill who said of him: "There was no one
on the whole continent who would have served our
purpose so well as Mr. Van Horne.  He had brains,
skill, experience, and energy, and was, besides, a
born leader of men."  The completion of this great
highway was another of the events that closely
linked the life of Canada's great Premier with the
forces that were creating her destiny.  The first
through transcontinental train on this line left
Montreal on June 26, 1886, for its journey of 2905
miles through what was then an almost trackless
wilderness.  On the completion of the road Queen
Victoria had sent a telegram characterising the
achievement as one "of great importance to the
British Empire."
</p>

<p>
The Grand Trunk was, however, Canada's pioneer
railway and it was the first railway in the British
Empire outside the United Kingdom.  One of
the leading factors in the varied group of the
creative forces of Canada, it is one of the
monumental illustrations of her claim to foresight and
enterprise in thus early recognising that the art
of transportation goes before and points the way
for advancing enlightenment.  The transportation
service is, as one of the eminent officials of this
line has said, "the advance guard of education."  In
1914 the Grand Trunk System, led by the vision
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
and foresight of Charles Melville Hays, completed
its transcontinental lines.  President Hays had
predicted that the Grand Trunk would be able to handle
the harvest of 1915, and his prediction was realised.
His forecast for the future included steamer lines
from Prince Rupert to Liverpool, by way of the
Panama Canal, and further extension of lines to
Australia, Japan, China, and Alaska.  In fact, the
Canadian prevision of unmapped possibilities of
commerce that would be afforded by means of the
new canal that thus connected two oceans was far
more alert and engaging than that of the United
States.
</p>

<p>
Beside the great enterprises involved in the
conquering of nature, there were others, not less
important, that contribute to the building up of human
life.  The claim of industry and economics is not
greater than the claim of intellectual development,
of scholarship, of that knowledge and refinement
that leads to the highest social culture of a nation.
</p>

<p>
When the Honourable James McGill of Montreal
left at his death (in 1813) a large bequest to found the
university that bears his name he added another to
the galaxy of Canada's benefactors and creators.
Mr. McGill had amassed large wealth in the fur
industry, and the college, after encountering some
years of difficulty, entered in 1885 on an era of
prosperity that has continually increased as the
years have gone by.  This era of prosperity was largely
due to the securing as Principal a gifted and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
remarkable young man, John William Dawson, who
is now so widely known to the world of science and
scholarship as Sir William Dawson.  For thirty-eight
years he served as Principal of McGill.  He
found it a struggling college with less than a
hundred students.  He left it with more than a thousand
students and with from eighty to ninety professors
and lecturers.  Finding it with three faculties, he
doubled that number, and as within fifteen years
he recognised the necessity of higher education for
women, there was opened (in 1883) the Donalda
Department, generously endowed by Lord Strathcona,
which has since developed into the Royal
Victoria College.  Lord Strathcona gave, first and
last, many millions of dollars to McGill; Sir William
Macdonald gave to the Engineering department
one million, including with this the schools of
physics and chemistry, and he also equipped the
Macdonald College at Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue which
is incorporated with McGill.  Peter Redpath, a
public-spirited merchant of Montreal, presented the
museum that bears his name (now rich in collections)
and he also gave the Library building which houses,
for McGill, the largest library in Canada save that
of Parliament.  These liberal gifts of Mr. Redpath
were still further increased by Mrs. Redpath's
generous contributions.  The unsurpassed opportunities
at McGill place her graduates on equality
of scholarly prestige with those of Oxford and
of the other great universities of the world.  No
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
consideration of the creative forces of Canada could
fail to include this inestimable contribution that
makes for nobler life offered by McGill University.
</p>

<p>
To the intellectual development and liberal culture
of the Dominion the universities of Toronto and of
Laval render priceless aid.  The former is noted
somewhat at length in a subsequent chapter.  Laval
University, founded in Quebec in 1852, by the
Quebec seminary, dates back, through that institution,
to its founder, François de Laval-Montmorency,
the first Bishop of Quebec, who landed in Canada
in 1659, and founded the seminary in 1663.  This
great French-Canadian university, fairly enshrined
in sacred tradition and archaic history, is an object
of pilgrimage to all visitors in Quebec.  To its vast
resources of scholarship it adds the perpetuation of
the name of one of the most remarkable prelates
that the world has known.  A son of the crusaders,
a true successor of the apostles who shared the life
of Jesus Christ, a man of boundless charity, of
intrepid heroism, of a life so consecrated to the
Divine Service that its passing from earth in the
May of 1708 cannot efface the vividness of his image
nor dim the brightness of the atmosphere which
enshrines his memory, he was deeply concerned with
the education of his people.  Monseigneur Laval
specified that he desired that his seminary should be
"a perpetual school of virtue."  The Abbé de
Saint-Vallier of France bequeathed to this Seminary in
1685 the sum of forty-two thousand francs, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
Bishop Laval himself left to its maintenance his
entire estate.  The museums, lecture halls, and the
library of Laval University are open to visitors.
It is rich in historic portraits and in many fine
examples of French art.  On the visit of the Prince
of Wales (later Edward VII.) to Canada in 1860,
the heir to the British throne founded the Prince
of Wales Prize, which has remained one of the
features of the university.
</p>

<p>
In the equalisation of educational opportunities
to an unusual degree Canada is especially strong.
While the fiftieth anniversary of the consolidation
of the Dominion will not be celebrated until July 1, of
1917, and while as a nation she is not yet half a
century old, her educational privileges are recognised
as among the best in the world.  Not a single
province is without its fully equipped educational
system.  Free public schools, high schools, colleges,
and universities abound.  There are already
twenty-one universities in Canada.  The standard of
instruction is very high; the schools of applied
science, law, medicine, and technical instruction
are among the best in the world.  They offer all late
modern appliances for chemical, metallurgical, and
electrical experiment: civil, mining, and electrical
engineering are offered with unsurpassed
opportunities for practice and research.  The Royal
Military College at Kingston presents a complete
course in Engineering and in all branches of military
science.  The Royal Naval College at Halifax offers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
equally complete opportunities for naval training.
</p>

<p>
Not even the most fragmentary survey of the
creative forces of the Dominion could fail to
emphasise the notable and beneficent work of Archbishop
Taché, who, born in Quebec in 1823, became identified
with the Far West in 1845, where he remained,
an heroic and impassioned figure, until his death,
in 1894.  The Archbishop's mother was a daughter
of Joliet, the explorer; the same intrepid spirit
that led this pathfinder on through the wilderness
characterised the great prelate in a remarkable
degree.  At the age of twenty-two he had been
admitted to the priesthood; he received his training
in Montreal and was, from the first, "stirred to the
soul by missionary zeal"; he eagerly embraced the
call to the hardships, the most insurmountable
difficulties, of the pioneer missionary.  He traversed
the country for four hundred miles around from
St. Boniface (across the river from Winnipeg) where he
was stationed; his journeys were by canoe and dog
sledges; he encountered physical hardships which
seem incredible for human endurance.  When the
slender financial support of his mission threatened
to fail he pleaded that just sufficient revenue be
continued to provide bread and wine for the sacrament,
saying that for himself he would "find food in the fish
of the lakes, and clothing from the skins of the wild
animals."  In his later years he was made the Bishop
of Manitoba and he was present, a venerable and
honoured figure, on the opening of the first Assembly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
of that Province in 1870-71.  Archbishop Taché
was one of the nearer friends and associates of Lord
Strathcona, also when the latter, as Donald
A. Smith, was so long the dominating personality in the
North-West.  The life and work of this great
Archbishop of the Catholic faith are forever bound up
with the history and development of Manitoba.
There are other notable Catholic prelates, a
remarkable group: his Eminence Cardinal Taschereau, the
first Canadian prelate to become a Prince of the
Church; Archbishops Bourget and Fabre of
Montreal; Archbishops Lynch and Walsh of Toronto;
Archbishop Cleary of Kingston; and Bishop Demers
of Vancouver are all among the great religious
leaders whose influence for the general advancement
of the people, as well as for the progress of religion,
has been wide and invaluable.
</p>

<p>
Bishop Strachan of Toronto, a priest of the Church
of England, whose life fell between 1778-1867, was
a strong force both in church and state.  No servant
of God within the entire Dominion has left a nobler
record.  When (in 1832) the scourge of Asiatic
cholera swept over Canada, it was he who inspired
courage, administered the sacraments to the dying,
and sustained the survivors.  His aid, both legislative
and otherwise, to the cause of education, and his
activity in promoting all progress in Ontario, are
among the most precious records of that province.
One passage from his personal counsel may well be
held in memory:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Cultivate, then, my young friends, all those virtues
which dignify the human character, and mark in your
behaviour the respect you entertain for everything venerable
and holy.  It is this conduct that will raise you above
the rivalship, the intrigues, and slanders by which you will
be surrounded.  They will exalt you above this little spot
of earth, so full of malice, contention, disorder; and extend
your views, with joy and expectation, to that better
country."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Nothing in all religious advancement is more
impressive than the great work of the Methodist
denomination in Canada.  Their vital and fervent
spirit has kindled the zeal of the people with the
flame of the living coal on the altar.  One of the
remarkable contributions to the lofty order of
creative forces was made by the Reverend Doctor
Egerton Ryerson, the celebrated Methodist leader,
and the organiser of the Public School System of
Ontario.  In 1841 Doctor Ryerson became Principal
of Victoria College; in 1844 ne was appointed
Superintendent of Public Schools in Upper Canada,
and he brought to bear upon educative work the
enduring impress of his ideals.  "By education I
mean not the mere acquisition of certain arts," he
said, "but that instruction and discipline which
qualify men for their appropriate duties in life, as
Christians, as persons in business, and as members
of the civil community."  Doctor Ryerson lived until
the year 1882, and he thus was enabled to see much
of the fruit of his wise and untiring endeavour.
</p>

<p>
Although the Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid
Laurier is still, happily, dwelling among his countrymen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
and lending to many notable occasions the rare
distinction and the prestige of his presence, the
gratifying fact that he is a factor in the life of the
hour cannot constrain one to fail to express the
recognition of Canada's indebtedness to his splendid
services during her more recent past.  A native of
Quebec (born in 1841) his unqualified devotion has
been given to the Empire without regard to restriction
of race or language.  His political career as a
member of the House opened before he was thirty
years of age; six years later he was called to the
Cabinet; and in June, 1896, at the age of fifty-five,
he became the Premier of the Dominion.  When
the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria was
celebrated, one special feature was the invitation
extended to all the Prime Ministers of the British
Empire to honour it by their presence.  Among these
Ministers Sir Wilfrid was singled out for many
special attentions.  He was distinguished by being
made a member of the Imperial Privy Council; he
was appointed a Knight of the Grand Cross of the
Order of St. Michael and St. George; he was invested
with honorary degrees by both Oxford and
Cambridge; he was made an honorary member of the
Cobden Club which awarded to him a gold medal
"in recognition of exceptional and distinguished
services to the cause of international and free
exchange."  Sir Wilfrid Laurier visited President Faure
and the President of the French Republic named
him as a Grand Officier of the Legion d'Honneur.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
In 1902 Sir Wilfrid was invited to the Coronation
of Edward VII. and his presence at this imposing
ceremonial reflected distinction of the highest
order on Canada by his brilliant and impressive
addresses made on Imperial interests and affairs.
England could not but realise that in the Parliament
of the vast country over the sea there were orators
who would add new lustre to her national eloquence
and splendid traditions.
</p>

<p>
Well, indeed, has Canada been called the country
of the Twentieth Century.  To no inconsiderable
extent the appliances that introduce a new order of
life have been either invented or first experimentally
considered in the Dominion.  Indeed, as if already
under the spell of Destiny, these great modern
miracles of communication&mdash;the railways, telegraphs,
and telephones will be forever associated with the
name of Canada; the country that cradled James
Jerome Hill and Samuel Rogers Calloway; in which
William Cornelius Van Horne and Charles Melville
Hays gave the best years of their lives to building
and improving transportation facilities; in which
Alexander Graham Bell initiated his experiments
and where he still makes his summer home; and in
which Thomas Alva Edison worked as a telegraph
operator on the pioneer railway, where he printed
and issued <i>The Grand Trunk Herald</i>, the first
newspaper ever printed on a railway train.
</p>

<p>
In the light of the eventful period that has passed
since that momentous date of August, 1914, it would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
seem to be a curiously prophetic glimpse that rose,
like a mirage on the far horizon, before Sir Wilfrid
Laurier when, in response to a toast at the banquet
given on June 18, 1897, by the Imperial Institute in
London in honour of the Colonial premiers, he said:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"... England has proved at all times that she can
fight her own battles; but if a day were ever to come when
England was in danger, let the bugle sound, let the fires be
lighted upon the hills, and in all parts of the Colonial
possessions whatever we can do shall be done to help her....  I
have been asked if the sentiments of the French population
of Canada were those of absolute loyalty towards the
British Empire.  Let me say ... it was the privilege of
the men of our generation to see the banners of France
and of England entwined together victoriously on the
banks of the Alma, on the heights of Inkermann, and on
the walls of Sebastopol."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Seventeen years had but passed&mdash;from 1897 to
1914&mdash;when again the banners of France and
England were intertwined; and since that fateful
midsummer's day what treasure and sacrifice has
not Canada poured out with a courage and unflinching
heroism for which words furnish no adequate
interpretation.  The future of the Canadian Dominion
is seen, in the words of the poet, as "along the grand
roads of the universe."  Her citizens realise that
"To-day is a new day" and the hand of Destiny is
leading her on to exemplify to the world a new and
a more glorious civilisation.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
QUEBEC AND THE PICTURESQUE MARITIME REGION
</h3>

<p>
The Maritime region of Canada embraces only,
strictly speaking, Prince Edward Island, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick; although Quebec is
sometimes thought of as being included in this
historic portion of the Dominion, because of its
geographical situation.  The city of Quebec has
always been a favourite point of pilgrimage, and
when Mr. Howells, in his early youth, enshrined
it in a half-romantic narrative, as the scene of
<i>Their Wedding Journey</i>, its attractions were
heightened by his facile and charming pen.  The
old French city dates back to 1608, and its history,
for more than a century and a half, is really the
history of Canada as well.  All the maritime
provinces of Canada take a prominent place in poetic
legend and lore as well as in historical associations.
When, in 1845, the poet Longfellow wrote his tender
and touching, though historically misleading poem,
Evangeline, the poem focussed the general attention
on Acadia (the modern Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick), and particular attention on the little
village of Grand-Pré, which,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "... distant, secluded still,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
lying in the fruitful valley, invited many excursions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
of those who delight in pilgrimages to poetic shrines.
For
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Plant a poet's word but deep enough,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and woodland or hill, mountain or shore, are thereby
enchanted.  The Maritime region, still vocal with
the dreams and discoveries of adventurous spirits;
where all pledge and prophecy still linger in the air;
where impassioned endeavour, long-patient endurance,
faith to break a pathway through to untrod
regions with some Ulysses to inspire a faith that it
is never too late to seek a newer world&mdash;how
wonderful is the spell this province weaves around the
wanderer!
</p>

<p>
The noble St. Lawrence is a river that fairly
fulfils the purposes of a sea, with its kaleidoscopic
shore lines, now bold and forbidding, now dreamy
and undefined with their fleeting, ethereal beauty;
and all the maritime land is pervaded by memories
and associations of the brave Cabot who first
sighted Nova Scotia on June 24, 1497, the date of
the special festa of his native Italy&mdash;this festival
of San Giovanni, when all Venice is on the Grand
Canal in the fleets of gondolas; all Florence
illuminated at night, a resplendent spectacle from her
surrounding hills and her background of purple
amethyst mountains; and when Rome, at night,
disports herself in a thousand ways upon the
Campagna Mystica.  It was a fitting date for Cabot, the
Venetian, to discover the new land.  Voices unheard
by others had called to him; hands, from starry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
spaces, beckoned and led him on.  What was there
in the air but
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Winged persuasions and veiled destinies,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and all the past that came thronging to meet
all the future?  Cabot, Venetian born, English by
adoption, was followed by several other intrepid
explorers, and not to insist too much upon chronological
order, what a group of wonderful names are
associated with all the province of Quebec!  Cartier,
Champlain, Frontenac; Sir Humphrey Gilbert of
the Elizabethan period, whose brave expedition
was engulfed by winds and waves and went down
in the great deep off Campobello.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Alas, the land-wind failed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ice-cold grew the night,<br />
  And never more on sea or shore,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Sir Humphrey see the light."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the high ideals these heroes brought did not
go down nor become extinguished in the
storm-tossed waters.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Say not the struggle naught availeth!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The struggle always avails, and leaves humanity
better and farther on than the effort finds it.  Then,
too, came a band of holy women, the Ursuline nuns,
and the sacred zeal of the novitiate lent its vital
power.  What is there not of spiritual nobility, of
sublimest self-sacrifice, of thrilling ideals, of a truer
life, associated with the early history of Canada?
This is all a part of her spellbinding power; it has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
left its significance on the air, its impress in wave
and tree and flower; its exaltation in every heart.
</p>

<p>
Quebec city is now becoming an attractive winter
haunt as well for those who love out-of-door sports
in the snowy carnival and who find themselves so
comfortably domiciled in the Château Frontenac.
The esplanade of Dufferin Terrace commands
delightful views across the St. Lawrence as far as the
Isle d'Orleans.  The Citadel, the Parliament Buildings,
the Ursuline Convent, the Basilica, and the palace
of the Cardinal; together with the libraries, Laval
University, the drives to the old battle-grounds,
and the excursion of twenty-one miles to the shrine
of Saint Anne de Beaupré, provide the visitor with
abundance of interest.
</p>

<p>
The Ursuline Convent covers seven acres of ground
in almost the centre of the city of Quebec.  It is
the largest convent on the continent, and it dates
back to the July of 1639, when Marie Guyart, and
three other sisters of the Ursuline order, under
the protection of the Archbishop of Toulouse, were
led by Divine guidance to the new country of Canada
and entered on their work.  Marie Guyart, the
foundress of the convent, was the daughter of a
silk merchant of Tours, France, and her childhood
is invested with legends similar to those that are
associated with the name of Catherine of Sienna.
She married one Joseph Martin, but at the age of
twenty-three she was left a widow, and soon
became a novitiate of the Ursulines, rising to be the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
Mother Superior of her convent.  At the age of
forty, through the instrumentality of the Duchesse
D'Aiguillion, a niece of Cardinal Richelieu, she came
to "New France," and as recently as the August of
1911 this remarkable woman was canonised by the
Sacred College of Rome and named as a saint under
the title of Marie de l'Incarnation.  For thirty-three
years she pursued an exalted life in the convent of
her founding, and died at the age of seventy-two,
in the May of 1672.
</p>

<p>
A much-sought shrine is that of Saint Anne de
Beaupré, easy access to which is gained by the
electric railway, and in the summer it is a pleasant
local sail down the St. Lawrence.  The legend runs
that a group of Breton mariners, in the early years
of the seventeenth century, found themselves almost
engulfed in the river in the sudden violence of a
storm, and that they called upon <i>la bonne Saint Anne</i>
for deliverance; earnestly declaring that if she
would save them they would erect to her a shrine
at whatever point she should bring them to land,
and that this shrine should be sanctuary forever.
The good saint was merciful to their entreaties, and
guided them safely to land.  According to their
promise they at once built a small wooden chapel,
very near a spring whose waters are claimed to
possess a miraculous power for healing.  Since that
remote time three larger churches on this site have
successively replaced each other, the latest of which
dates only to 1878.  The primitive little chapel is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
still preserved, even as at Assisi the Portiuncula of
San Francisco is preserved near the magnificent
church of Santa Maria degli Angeli.
</p>

<p>
That marvellous ministry of San Francisco (who
is more familiarly known to us as Saint Francis
of Assisi), which was initiated in the thirteenth
century, love and sacrifice being the supreme ideals,
is recalled to mind by many of the legendary
incidents relating to Saint Anne de Beaupré.  The
mystic pilgrimage to Assisi, the "Seraphic City,"
is to some extent paralleled by the latter-day
pilgrimages to the shrine of Saint Anne.  "Any line of
truth that leads us above materialism," said
Arch-deacon Wilberforce of Westminster Abbey, whose
passing on to the life more abundant at the date of
this writing is but the larger inflorescence of his
beautiful and consecrated life&mdash;"any line of truth
that forces us to think and to remember that we
are enwrapped by the supernatural, is helpful and
stimulating.  A human life lived only in the seen
and felt, with no sense of the invisible, is a fatally
impoverished life; a poor, blind, wingless life."  Such
is the deep, perpetual conviction of mankind.
"The things that are seen are temporal; the things
that are not seen are eternal."  The mystic union of
the soul with God is the one underlying and
all-determining truth of life.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, beauty of holiness!<br />
  Of self-forgetfulness, of lowliness."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The latest church erected here as the shrine of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
Saint Anne was not completed until 1889, and it
was then proclaimed a Basilica by Pio Nono.  It is
one of colossal space and splendour, a remarkable
triumph of the Corinthian architecture, and between
the two towers of the front a superb statue of Saint
Anne rises above the façade.  The interior is rich in
paintings, sculpture, and mosaics, and on a column
of onyx is another statue of the saint in whose name
the church is built.  It has also a Scala Santa, as
has the vast Basilica of San Giovanni in Rome.
Thousands of suppliants annually visit the shrine of
Saint Anne.  The church has a superb chasuble, the
gift of Anne of Austria and Queen of France, the
mother of Louis XIV.  On either side of the entrance
are huge piles of canes and crutches and other
discarded appliances left as visible testimonials that
the efficacy of prayer at this shrine enabled their
possessors to dispense with adventitious aid.

</p>

<p>
A little book that is for sale by the Redemptorist
Fathers, who occupy the monastery connected with
this basilica, gives much curious information
regarding Saint Anne.  She is represented as being of the
tribe of Judah and of the royal family of David.  Her
husband, Joachim, was of the same family, and of
the same tribe, and the Blessed Virgin was their only
child.  This little record further narrates that the
body of Saint Anne was originally buried in
Bethlehem; but that it was brought to France by
Lazarus, who, after being raised from the dead by
the Saviour, became the first Bishop of Marseilles.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
The body of Saint Anne was then committed in
burial in the village of Apt, and when Charlemagne
came to celebrate the Easter feast&mdash;so runs the
story&mdash;a man who was blind, deaf, and dumb
came to the ceremonies, and was instantly restored.
The first words he uttered were: "This hollow
contains the body of Saint Anne, Mother of the
Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God."  With
the clue given in these words the hollow in the rocks
was then opened and the body disclosed.  This took
place in the year 792, and from that remote date
to the present time the church of Saint Anne at
Apt has been a notable place of worship and of
pilgrimage.
</p>

<p>
In the Basilica of Saint Anne de Beaupré there are
some rich and massive reliquaries of gold, inlaid
with jewels, in which the holy relics of the Saint are
enclosed.  All the gold and the jewels are votive
offerings left by grateful pilgrims to this shrine who
have been restored to health.  It is said that there
are literally bushels of watches, chains, bracelets,
rings, and all manner of personal adornments that
have been given in gratitude for blessings received.
Large gifts of money are also among the never-ceasing
stream of accumulating wealth.  Twelve
large chalices of gold, valued at ten thousand dollars
each, have been constructed from the rings and
personal articles left by the devotees.  The church
is fairly lined with the evidences of grateful
appreciation and the tributes of enthusiasm.  Each chapel
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
is a memorial gift of personal gratitude; the altar,
organ, and the electric light plant are also personal
gifts, and to these there is a rather curious story
attached.
</p>

<p>
Over a long period of years the newspapers of the
United States printed advertisements of a
widely-known patent-medicine lady who brewed her
concoctions, and either by means of their intrinsic
worth, or by the credulity of her customers, accumulated
a large fortune.  It is said that this lady made
a journey to the church of Saint Anne out of
curiosity, alone, but was suddenly stricken with a
severe illness; that she was cured by faith, and
that, through the direct influence of Saint Anne, she
then became a Catholic and was baptised in the
Basilica.  She at once abandoned her pursuit and
expressed her desire to devote her fortune to good
works, in honour of the Saint; and it was she who
presented the altar, the organ, and the electric
light plant as well as other rich and valuable
gifts.
</p>

<p>
Around the shrine of Saint Anne de Beaupré has
grown up a village of some two thousand people,
with hotels that accommodate hundreds of guests.
There are two convents, several schools, a hospital
(providing for the accommodation of the poor who
come to be healed), and the monastery already
mentioned.  The Sisters of the Rosary have also
established an academy for young women; the
Sisters of Saint Francis have built a convent for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
their order, and the Redemptorist nuns have their
own convent, while there is also a seminary for the
education of priests that has about three hundred
students.
</p>

<p>
The sermons of the Fathers who conduct the
services in the Basilica are preached in both French
and English.  Sixteen priests hold continual
devotions from four in the morning until nine at
night.  The number of annual visitors is estimated
as being nearly two hundred thousand, representative
of almost every nationality and language.
An American publicist asked one of the Fathers
whether every one who came was cured.  "By no
means," replied the priest; "although the miracles
are many."  When asked how he accounted for the
failures the Father replied that he was not able
to account for them; that a failure might be due
to lack of faith, or to some other reason not
disclosed to them.  Faith is always to be reckoned
with as a condition through which alone the Divine
energy can flow.
</p>

<p>
In the vicinity of Saint Anne there is some
beautiful scenery&mdash;Montmorency Falls, and other
points of interest; Quebec, too, is almost as much
frequented in winter as in summer, the bracing air
being to many the very elixir of life.
</p>

<p>
Quebec Province has always kept a distinctive
atmosphere of its own, due largely to the preponderance
of the French-Canadian element and to climatic
and topographical conditions.  Advantages and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
privileges are constantly increasing.  Macdonald
College, at Saint Anne de Bellevue, founded by Sir
William Macdonald, admits women on equal terms
with men, and beside the School of Agriculture, it
has a training institution in Domestic Science and
a school for training teachers.  The Department of
Domestic Science is free to all Canadian girls, and
students from outside of Canada pay a small tuition
fee and a modest fee of some three dollars and a
half a week for board-residence.  On this great
college Sir William Macdonald's initial expenditure
was five millions of dollars.  Five hundred
and sixty acres were secured for the farm, of which
nearly four hundred are devoted to the live stock
and grain department, while the remainder is divided
between vegetable, poultry, and bee culture, with
a liberal share allotted to horticulture.
</p>

<p>
It is to Quebec that the middle west of the United
States must look for the early history of its own
great explorers, missionaries, and pathfinders; for it
was from here that Champlain, La Salle, Marquette,
Joliet, and others fared forth on their pioneer
journeys through the Mississippi basin.  Champlain
died in Quebec on the Christmas Day of 1635; but
his burial-place is still undetermined.  The Jesuit
College in which Père Marquette was domiciled
ante-dated Harvard by one year, having been founded
in 1635.  Here Marquette made his plans for tours
along the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi,
with the object of converting the Indians.  This
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
Jesuit College bears the signal honour of being the
first institution for higher education on the North
American continent.
</p>

<p>
Something of the unique and exceptional character
of the great Cardinal Richelieu, whose tomb
in the Pantheon in Paris is an object of continual
pilgrimage by the visitors in the French capital,
seems to invest Quebec, the city of which he was
the real founder.  The convent and hospital of the
Hotel Dieu were due to the solicitude and enterprise
of his niece, the Duchesse d'Aiguillion, whose
interest centred in the promulgation of religion and
charities, and these institutions are still preserved as
memorial monuments to her fervour.  Quebec is
pre-eminently a city of churches and the old French
Cathedral dates back to 1647.  The interior is
enriched with several paintings of especial value,
among them Van Dyck's "Crucifixion," which was
painted in 1630, and which, in the Revolution of
1793, was purchased in Paris by the Abbé des
Jardins of Quebec, and presented to the cathedral.
In the sacristy are two large vaults filled with sacred
relics.  The vestments belonging to this cathedral
are superb.
</p>

<p>
An interesting church is the Anglican Cathedral,
standing in the centre of the city, to which the late
King Edward VII. presented an exquisite
Communion service.
</p>

<p>
For the celebration of the tercentenary of Quebec,
Cy Warman, that genial poet (who has set so much
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
of Canada to music), wrote an ode in the dialect of
the habitant, of which two stanzas run:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "How you kip yourself so young,<br />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The traveller with an impassioned devotion to
what he fondly calls "the quaint" may be signally
gratified in Quebec.  In the business section there
will be found one street only four feet in width,
quite rivalling the famous <i>via d'Aura</i> in Genoa,
the "Street of jewellers," where one can stand in
a shop on one side and almost reach his hand into
the shop opposite.
</p>

<p>
The Legislative Buildings are as delightful as
those in the other capitals of the Provinces of
Canada; and on the brow of the high bluffs are a
group of notable buildings of architectural beauty&mdash;the
splendid Château Frontenac, with its view of
thirty miles up and down the St. Lawrence valley;
flanked by monasteries, churches, and public
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
structures.  The citadel that crowns the height is
extremely picturesque to visitors who have all the
enjoyment, while the Canadian Government has
the doubtful felicity of keeping in due repair this
enormous fortification.  It was begun two hundred
and fifty years ago, and reconstructed in 1823, on
plans approved by the Duke of Wellington, at a
cost of twenty-five million.
</p>

<p>
It is not so well known that the Duke of Kent, the
father of Queen Victoria, was in command of the
garrison of Quebec for several years; that the
old-fashioned building in which he lived was restored
by his royal daughter, and that his grand-daughter,
the Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne (later
the Duchess of Argyle), when living at Rideau Hall,
Ottawa, during the period of the Marquis of Lorne's
Governor-Generalship of Canada, laid the
foundation stone of this restoration.  Moreover, the
Princess herself, with that versatility of gifts which
characterised Her Royal Highness, devised the
architectural plans for the new structure.  Nor
must the ancient gates of the old wall of Quebec
be ignored in any tribute to her picturesque
attractions.
</p>

<p>
Laval University in Quebec is a resort of many
students, on account of the numerous manuscripts
of historical value deposited there, many of them
containing graphic narratives of thrilling experiences
undergone in the pioneer days of the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
To turn from Quebec to the Maritime Provinces
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
proper, they are not by any means all scenery,
or historic and legendary atmosphere.  Nova
Scotia has large lumber interests, with fisheries,
mineral wealth, and great iron and steel
manufactures; and New Brunswick has ever been the
home of the great timber and now of pulpwood
so precious in these latter days.  Prince Edward
Island has a vast amount of red sandstone, and
in the regions adjacent to the Bay of Fundy an
enormous yield of hay is a feature of resource.
The position of the Maritime Provinces is particularly
noted by Mr. J. Castell Hopkins, in an extended
account of these regions, and he speaks of
the climatic peculiarities as one of the things with
which the inhabitants must reckon.  They have a
great coast-line in proportion to their area.  The
extensive bays and harbours suggest future increase
of ocean commerce and travel. "Prince Edward
Island is in reality all seacoast," writes Mr. Hopkins,
"for no matter how far into the interior one may
get, an hour's drive in any given direction will
almost invariably discover salt water.  There are
bays which deserve special mention, one, the
beautiful Bay de Chaleur, between New Brunswick
and the Gaspé Peninsula, without rock, reef, or
shoal in its ninety miles of length and forty-five of
breadth, is unique in its safety to navigators, while
the Bay of Fundy, between Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, with its mouth wide open to the south-west,
has features which are peculiar only to this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
bay.  Lying funnel-shaped toward the great tidal
movement from east to west it gathers from the
incoming tide a great deal of water that does not
belong to it, and then gradually compressing it
between narrowing shores, piles it up in places
sixty feet in height, and this gives rise to many
peculiarities.  This rush of tide twice a day has
formed enormous areas of marsh land and the process
is still going on.  The great rise and fall of water
in this bay has also a climatic effect in it that keeps
the air continually moving, and in the regions about
its head there is probably a cooler summer climate
than can be found anywhere in the same latitude."
</p>

</p>

<p>
This peculiarity unfits the climate for fruit-raising,
but is especially favourable for live stock.
The production of hay is very large.  The water
supply is inexhaustible, and water-power is always
at hand to grind grain or to transform trees into
lumber.  The spruce and fir are found here in great
abundance.  The Maritime Provinces have practically
no mountains, although a few heights approaching
two thousand feet may be seen.  Of late years
the people of this region have been urged to develop
agriculture to a greater extent.  It is already
demonstrated that wheat, barley, oats, buckwheat, and
corn can be cultivated with profit; potatoes and
carrots also thrive.  In New Brunswick, apples,
pears, grapes, and cherries do well; and every one
knows of the apple orchards of Nova Scotia.  The
dairy industry is one of the greatest sources of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
revenue.  Factories for the making of cheese and
butter are numerous; and quite apart from the
home market, the facilities for export to Europe
and to the markets of the South are one special
factor in the conditions for profit.  Agricultural
schools, a feature of the Dominion, have a particularly
good representative at Truro, and the Federal
Government has established experimental farms
and stations throughout the Dominion, while the
provincial authorities have also organised similar
enterprises under their own jurisdiction.  The
Provincial Government of Ontario, in particular,
has devoted large sums to the encouragement of
agriculture, having three experimental farms, one
of these being devoted to fruit.
</p>

<p>
The Central Experimental Farm of the Dominion
Government is at Ottawa and there are branch
farms at Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island;
at Fredericton, New Brunswick; at Nappan and
Kentville, Nova Scotia; at Saint Anne de la
Pocatière, Cap Rouge, and Lenoxville in Quebec; at
Brandon, Manitoba; at Indian Head, Rosthern,
and Scott, Saskatchewan; at Lethbridge and
Lacombe in Alberta; and also at Agassiz, Invermere,
and Sidney in British Columbia.  Sub-stations have
also been established at Fort Vermilion in the
Peace River District, at Grouard near Lesser Slave
Lake, Grande Prairie, and Forts Resolution and
Providence&mdash;all these being in northern Alberta.
At the Central Experimental Farm (at Ottawa)
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
much attention has been paid to tests, as to the
growing of oats, barley, varieties of grass, and
turnips and mangels.  Nor has the culture of
ornamental shrubs and trees been neglected; and
orchards of various kinds of fruit have been planted
with watchful care.  Potatoes, too, have received
special attention as one of the most profitable
products of this region.
</p>

<p>
The picturesque attractions of the Maritime
Provinces, moreover, tend to make them each year a
summer resort for increasing numbers of people from
the United States and elsewhere.  Mail routes are
well extended; the postal service is good; and the
improvements in navigation have included the
erection of many lighthouses on the prominent
headlands and in the harbours, so that the scenic
panorama at night witnessed by those on or near
the coast is often most fascinating, and the presence
of these aids to navigation is full of practical
reassurance to those who travel by water.
</p>

<p>
Halifax is important not only as the capital of
Nova Scotia, but as the leading seaport of Canada on
the Atlantic coast.  It has a magnificent harbour
whose even depth is a joy to the navigator; it is
curiously free from extremes of temperature, the
coldest day of one average year being but eight
degrees below zero (in February), the warmest day
falling in early September when the mercury
registered eighty-seven degrees.  The evenings are
always cool.  The city has its citadel, its rocky areas,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
and beside its university (Dalhousie) there are
colleges doing various special work, institutions for the
defective classes, and several libraries, that of the
Institute of Science and History being consolidated
with the Library of Parliament.  In the magnitude
of its exports Halifax stands next to Montreal.  In
its imports it ranks third, Montreal and Toronto
alone taking precedence of the Nova Scotian capital.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
MONTREAL AND OTTAWA
</h3>

<p>
Montreal, the metropolis of Canada; Ottawa, the
Capital; each a city supreme in a certain individual
type; within three hours of each other by rail, are
closely inter-related, as are New York and
Washington in the United States.  In England, and in
France, the Capital and the metropolis are one; but
there are certain advantages to a country when its
legislative centre may be kept apart from the
engulfing life of its commercial metropolis.  It was one
of the felicitous inspirations of Queen Victoria
when she chose the little village that had been
known as Bytown (in honour of Colonel By, the
builder of the Rideau Canal) to be the capital of
the Dominion and to be known as Ottawa.  For
many years the parliamentary sessions had alternated
between Montreal and Quebec.  The foundation
stone of the new Parliament Building was laid by
the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII.) in 1860,
when the youthful prince made his memorable
tour of the Dominion and the United States.  Some
seven years later the first parliamentary session
was held in the new capital.  A most significant
session it was, as it marked the date of the complete
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
federation of all the Canadian Provinces then
existent and ushered in the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
It is an anomaly that Montreal, a commercial
metropolis of the most prominent and pronounced
type, should be the one Canadian city that most
lends herself to idealisation.  One treads her
thoroughfares as if under the spell of some Merlin of
old, and sees the moving panorama of life as if in
distance and in dream.
</p>

<p>
One is led on by invisible hands; he is haunted
by voices that for centuries have been silent on
earth; beckoned by some inconceivable sign and
signal in the dreamy blue of the distant horizon,
in whose shades phantom forms are vanishing.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Flitting, passing, seen, and gone,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
baffling all recognition, yet beckoning by mystic
flash from the ethereal realm.  Was it one of these
vanishers, questioned the observer, as a gleam passes
in the distance, or was it instead a flash from some
electric circuit, to be scientifically accounted for?
One is steeped in bewilderment, for who indeed
may interpret this legend-haunted air?  The life
of the dead centuries presses closely upon the life
of the throbbing hour.
</p>

<p>
The visitor to Montreal instantly feels that
anything might be possible in the strangely fascinating
atmosphere of this old-world city.  One has more
than crossed the border line between the Dominion
and the United States; one has crossed the border
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
line of centuries.  Is it 1535 or is it 1915?  The
twentieth century clasps hands with some dim
historic period.  The result is bewildering.  All modern
beauty of vista, of groups of sculpture, or the
architectural magnificence of stately and splendid
public buildings, of magnificent private residences,
of cathedral and churches, of great institutions,
of all latter-day conveniences and luxuries of life&mdash;all
these, as one would find in New York or Paris;
yet with them, as an intangible and invisible scenic
setting, an impalpable atmosphere lingers, that
haunting impress of the far-away past, of historic
associations that persist with singular vitality; of
great personalities who trod these regions where
now stretch away the handsome modern streets;
of intense purposes borne on the air, purposes that
struggled to fulfilment, or went down to temporary
defeat in darkness and tragedy&mdash;all these seem to
throng about the visitor who for the first time finds
himself in Montreal.
</p>

<p>
Montreal may be entered by many ways, by land
or by sea; but she is very conveniently entered from
New England.
</p>

<p>
It is a picturesque trip, that between Boston and
Montreal, and as the sun journeys onward to the
horizon line the purple valleys and the rose and
amber that tinge the summits of the Green Mountains
afford luxurious contrasts of colour.  In the
late evening the brilliant illuminations of Montreal
at the west side of the Victoria Jubilee Bridge,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
spanning the St. Lawrence River, come into
view.
</p>

<p>
In all Canada, perhaps, there is no more beautiful
view than that of Montreal lying under the
white moonlight with Mount Royal in the shadowy
background, as seen from the railway train crossing
the Victoria Jubilee Bridge.  The broken reflections
of the moon are seen in a wide track in
the rippling, dancing waters in the middle of the
river, while every lamp of the long rows that border
each side of the bridge is repeated in the river
below.  The water front of the city is all aglow
with brilliant lights; backward, in the soft,
receding shadows, gleam points of light from myriad
homes, and the long lines of street lamps make
illuminated avenues of the thoroughfares.  The
moon, like a silver globe, hangs over Mount Royal,
while floating clouds imprison the radiance for an
instant and then, relenting, set it free again.

</p>

<p>
Nor is the view by daylight less to be remembered.
The mighty river sweeps under the massive and
majestic structure, while hundreds of steamers,
sailing vessels, steam tugs, craft, indeed, of every
description, are plying the waters of the St. Lawrence
opposite the harbour, and the vast city of Montreal
in its transcendently beautiful location at the base
of the mountain completes a picture never to be
forgotten.  For miles the harbour is lined with
imposing stone structures, the city's warehouses; and
the numerous manufactories, with their tall chimneys
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
sending out great volumes of smoke, stretch away on
the shores of the St. Lawrence as far as the eye can
reach, with their story of the wonderful commercial
metropolis of the Canadian empire.  The picture is
one to enchain the artist and the social statistician
as well.  It is of itself a study in economics and
commercial development.
</p>

<p>
From an engineering standpoint this bridge ranks
with the foremost structures of contemporary
achievements.  The Victoria Tubular Bridge which
it replaced was built in 1860, and was at that time
considered the eighth wonder of the world; but it
became insufficient to meet the increase of traffic,
and in October of 1897 the work of building the
present stupendous structure was inaugurated.
The chief engineer was Mr. Joseph Hobson, whose
ingenuity and skill contrived to utilise the tube
of the old bridge as a roadway, on which a
temporary steel span was moved out to the first pier,
the new structure being then erected outside the
temporary span.  Begun in 1897, it was completed
in 1899, and during its construction the enormous
traffic of the Grand Trunk System was delayed
very little, a remarkable fact when it is realised
that while the old bridge weighed nine thousand
and forty-four tons, the new one weighs twenty-two
thousand tons, and while the width of the
former was but sixteen feet, the width of the new
bridge is sixty-six feet, with a height of from
forty to sixty feet, while the one it replaced was but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
eighteen feet high.  The old bridge was built for seven
million dollars, while the new one cost two million
pounds.  The latter carries trains in both directions
at the same time, trains with two consolidation engines
and tenders, coupled, whose average weight is five
thousand two hundred pounds to each foot of
length, with a car-load of four thousand pounds to
the foot; and a moving load on each carriage way
of a thousand pounds a foot.  Nor is there any limit
prescribed for the speed of either railway trains or
carriage and motor car crossings.
</p>

<p>
This magnificent structure is, indeed, a marvel of
the age.  There was a pretty scene that lives in
memory which marked the date of October 16, 1901.
On the very spot where the Prince of Wales (later
King Edward) stood when he drove the last rivet
in the old Victoria Tubular Bridge in 1860, stood
their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of
Cornwall and York (now King George and Queen
Mary), with a group of the officials of the railway,
thus linking into succession notable events separated
by more than forty years.
</p>

<p>
As one of the wonderful achievements of the
opening year of the twentieth century, this bridge
draws thousands of sightseers, every year, to study
its beauty and marvellous efficiency.
</p>

<p>
The scenes that Cartier saw fade from the eye,
and one sees the solid and splendid business quarters
of Montreal, the charming and enticing residential
sections.  Yet again an anomaly&mdash;a mountain in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
heart of a city!  And it is ascended, not by climbing
over perpendicular rocks, but by an easy gliding
car that makes its ascent as much a part of a
pleasure drive as might be the drive in Hyde Park
or in the Bois du Boulogne.  Mount Royal suggests
in some way the Monreale of Palermo, save that it is
crowned by no cathedral, but from its height of a
thousand feet it offers a panorama of city and river
and wood and mountain ranges that is indescribable.
What must be the influence on a city's life of having
such a resort as this?  It is in itself a prospect of
unique and unrivalled beauty; it is a playground
for all forms of recreation, <i>al fresco</i>; it is spiritual
sanctuary.  Again, the mystic vanishers beset one's
footsteps, and signals beckon from the vast azure
sea of the air.  The sunset splendours glow and
deepen over Westmount, Montreal's most beautiful
suburb, which climbs up the mountain side, with
such views, such charm of outlook, as one might well
travel many a league to find.
</p>

<p>
It is again in that realm where nothing is but what
is not, that one is led to that haunt of the student
and the antiquary, the Château de Ramezay, built
more than two hundred years ago by Claude de
Ramezay, then governor of Montreal.  And if the
American Congressional Commission, comprising
Franklin, Chase, and Carroll, who sat there for days
and nights arguing, pleading, insisting that Canada
should unite with the thirteen states in their
rebellion and defiance of King George, had prevailed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
had the Canadians yielded, what would the course of
history have been?  How would its trend of events
have contrasted with the present?  It is an interesting
and curious speculation not without historical
value of its own.
</p>

<p>
The Antiquarian and Numismatic Society of
Montreal acquired the Château de Ramezay in 1895,
after the building had passed through several
vicissitudes of ownership, to make of it an Historical
Portrait Gallery and Museum.  One finds here a copy
of the old painting in oils of the first Ursuline
Monastery in Quebec, which was built in 1640, and
destroyed by fire a year later, the original work
being in the Ursuline Convent in Quebec.  In the
foreground of the picture is the house that was
occupied by Bishop Laval in 1699.  A large number
of interesting old portraits are here, the gifts of the
descendants or adherents of the sitters themselves;
and coats-of-arms, antiquities, documents, and
other matters of interest make up a valuable
historical museum.
</p>

<p>
Montreal is enshrined in legendary lore.  The Ile
de la Cité, in Paris, is hardly more entangled in
mystic story than is the metropolis of the Dominion.
The tale that has come down the ages that the
martyred preacher Saint-Denis walked from the
heights of Montmartre, near Paris, to the Ile de la
Cité, carrying his severed head in his hands, does
not more challenge one's confidence in its
authenticity than do many of the legends that haunt the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
imagination of the visitor in Montreal.  About the
middle of the seventeenth century a permanent
settlement was founded in La Place Royale, near
where the old Customs House now stands.  Upon a
warehouse in close proximity is placed a tablet with
an inscription to the effect that on this site stood
the first manor-house of Montreal, which from 1661
to 1712 was the seminary of St. Sulpice.
</p>

<p>
The story of the settlement of La Place Royale
is one of the mystical tales to be found in the
Relations des Jésuites, and it tells that Jean Jacque
Olier, an Abbé of France, suddenly experienced a
deep religious re-awakening, and gave himself with
ardour to devising and carrying out new projects in
connection with the education and training of young
priests in St. Sulpice, Paris.  Hearing of the
settlement on the island of Montreal he conceived the
idea of founding a mission there.  The Sieur de la
Dauversiére, of Brittany, had conceived a similar
project, and the two men met, by chance, as
strangers at Meudon.  Although they had never seen
each other before, they fell into each other's arms
and related their plans; they obtained the aid of
Madame de Bullion and other influential leaders at
court, and formed a society known as the Compagnie
de Notre Dame de Montreal.  It is further related
that about this time a young nun, Jeanne Mance,
had a vision in which she was called to go to the
same place and found a convent.  A French writer
records that then a miracle took place: "God, lifting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
for her the veils of space, showed her while yet
in France the shores of the island and the site for
Ville Marie, at the foot of the mountain."  The little
company landed from the St. Lawrence on May 18,
1642, and at the first religious service held, Father
Vimont said, "You are a grain of mustard seed that
shall rise and grow till its branches overshadow the
earth.  You are few, but your work is the work of
God.  His smile is upon you."
</p>

<p>
Thirty years later the first streets were laid out
in Montreal.  Religion and education went hand in
hand.  In 1721 the population had increased to
three thousand; steam navigation was initiated
in 1809 by the second steamboat built in America
(the first being that of Robert Fulton which plied
on the Hudson in 1807) and the steam river traffic
between Montreal and Quebec was thus begun.
Navigation across the Atlantic from Canada opened
in 1831; the first railroad was successfully started
in 1836; and Montreal was incorporated in 1832.
The Lachine Canal had been completed in 1825.
From the first, Montreal has been prosperous, and
the present metropolis, rapidly nearing a population
of three-quarters of a million, with its nine miles
of river front, its fifty public parks, its admirable
municipal improvements in all modern appliances,
stands as a monument to the faith and devotion
of its early founders led to the wilderness as by
vision.
</p>

<p>
Montreal has an Art Gallery, of Greek Ionic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
architecture, built of Vermont marble, the entrance hall
lined with Bottichino marble, with handsome staircases,
and numerous salons.  The collection of pictures
and sculpture is already an interesting one, and
an annual Loan Exhibition is made possible by the
generous enterprise of the citizens, many of the
private collections being very rich in artistic
treasures.  Nor is music neglected in Montreal.  The
organ recitals at Christ Church Cathedral are
famous far beyond the city.
</p>

<p>
Women's work in Montreal is a very prominent
and valuable feature of the city's life; including
much social service work and the promotion of
guilds of various orders.  The Canadian woman,
indeed, plays an important part in the entire life
and progress of the Dominion.  The churches of
Montreal include many of great beauty, such as
Notre Dame, St. James' Cathedral, Christ Church
Cathedral, and others.  The Grey Nunnery, covering
an entire block, and the Royal Victoria Hospital are
impressive buildings; and the banks and office
structures of the city are in many cases very
imposing and seem to duplicate the stately and
impressive architecture of London.
</p>

<p>
There is no Canadian industry that is without
representation in Montreal markets, and her
manufactures have a world-wide repute.  Montreal is the
greatest grain port of America, taking precedence
of New York in the quantity of grain handled at her
port.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
</p>

<p>
Situated on an island thirty-two miles long and
from four to eight miles wide, at the junction of
the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, Montreal is a
seaport, although a thousand miles from the sea;
for the construction of a thirty-foot channel enables
the largest ocean vessels to sail to her docks.  The
Canadian canals enable the steamers of the Great
Lakes to sail to the harbour of Montreal, where
they transfer their cargoes to the ocean steamers.
Montreal has, indeed, almost unrivalled facilities
by both rail and water.  Her harbour is under the
control of a Board of Commissioners appointed by
the Government of the Dominion, and twenty-seven
millions of dollars had been spent in providing
the most approved modern facilities up to
the beginning of 1916, with nine millions more
for the same purpose already available.  Both her
export and import trade have been increasing so
rapidly that even these liberal endowments are taxed
to the utmost.
</p>

<p>
With this commercial supremacy, the City of
the Royal Mountain offers educational advantages
and scientific culture of the highest order.  The
great value of the McGill University is not only
the distinction of its intellectual position, or the
high quality of its work, but also its guarantees
of equality of educational opportunity to all whose
career comes within the sphere of its influence.
The princely endowments of the late Lord Strathcona
and of Sir William Macdonald provided a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
foundation whose far-reaching value can hardly
be estimated, and the university has been singularly
fortunate in the character and endowments that
have graced her staff of professors.  While McGill
offers special training of the most advanced type
in preparation for the various professions, and
for the acquirement of technical qualifications,
she has never yielded to any purely utilitarian
standards.  She has held to the ideal that Education is
primarily for the soul herself, and not, as said the
Grecian philosopher of old, "to be undertaken in
the spirit of merchants and traders, with a view
to buying or selling."  It is the glory of McGill that
she sends forth, not only culture and trained skill,
but men prepared for the duties of citizenship, and
the obligations, the privileges, the responsibilities
that await them as members of society.

McGill celebrated in 1904 her seventy-sixth
anniversary, and in the lofty and glowing address
made on that occasion by Principal and Vice-Chancellor
Peterson, we find him saying&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Manners are formed and personality is built up in the
school of life,&mdash;even the student school.  Honesty, purity,
reverence,&mdash;all the moral virtues, in fact,&mdash;are just as
important for the youth of the country as are learning and
scholarships.  We want to have a hall-mark for McGill men
by which they may be known and recognised the world
over.  It lies with our students themselves to set the
standard.  'How truly it is in man,' as Mr. Gladstone said
to the students in Edinburgh, 'in man, and not in his
circumstances, that the secret of his destiny resides.  For most
of you that destiny will take its final bent towards evil or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
towards good, not from the information you imbibe, but
from the habits of mind, thought, and life that you shall
acquire during your academic career.  In many things it is
wise to believe before experience; to believe until you may
know; and believe me when I tell you that the thrift of
time will repay you in after life with an usury of profit
beyond your most sanguine dreams, and that the waste of
it will make you dwindle, alike in intellectual and in moral
stature, beneath your darkest reckonings.'"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was one little incident in the scientific
history of McGill that is not without its special
interest to-day in the safe-guarding of human life.
This was the first application of wireless telegraphy
to the operation of moving trains.  Many people now
believe that in the wireless control of moving trains
lies in the future the most effectual protection
against railway accidents.  It was in 1902, just
six years after Marconi made his successes in
England, that the experiment was first tried.
Professor Ernest Rutherford, now of the University
of Manchester, and Professor Howard T. Barnes,
both of the Macdonald physical laboratory of
McGill, were invited to accompany the American
Association of General Passenger and Ticket Agents,
who in that year held a convention in Portland.
The Grand Trunk provided a special train from
Chicago to Portland, and on this train, when
moving at fifty miles an hour, signals were
exchanged with a given station, and with the
comparatively simple apparatus installed it was found
possible to keep the train in communication with a
station for a distance of eight or ten miles.

Ottawa was obviously created to be the capital
of the Dominion.  Her interesting history, initiated
by the choice of Queen Victoria, the glory of whose
long reign is a priceless possession of the Dominion,
attracts careful study; and the first view over the
charming city and its equally charming environment,
is one to linger for a lifetime.  The majestic
beauty of her Parliament Buildings
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Set on the landscape like a crown;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
towers and bastions and buttresses clinging to the
height on which they are built above the river;
and the exquisite outline of the turrets and
high-pointed tower of the magnificent Château Laurier
all silhouetted against the western sky&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Dim in the sunset's misty fires,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
offer a pictorial enchantment to linger in the memory.
This young city, with hardly more than half a century's
life behind it, has made itself a distinctive
point in the States as well as in the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Ottawa?  Have you stayed in
Château Laurier?" are interrogations not unusual
among us in the States when Canada is discussed.
Is Ottawa, with its artistic Château Laurier, the
Carcasonne of the newer world?  For surely no
guest of the Château Laurier quite dreams of
classing it among ordinary hotels; in it he tastes
a flavour of something a little apart, of life in an
artistically appointed palace which he enters from
his railway train through a brilliantly lighted marble
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
corridor reminding him of the entrance to Bertolini's
on the terraced hills of Naples.  The Ottawa
Grand Trunk Station itself, built of white marble
with its pillared façade, is like a Greek temple, and
the richly decorated corridors and salons of the
Château are as reminiscent of Venice as of France.
This magnificent hotel was of course named after
Canada's great statesman, the Right Honourable
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, G.C.M.G., whose bust in marble
adorns the entrance corridor.  The decorations are
of the François I. period; the building is absolutely
fireproof, and the luxurious furnishing suggests
that of private palaces rather than of an hotel.
</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting places in Ottawa is the
Archives, a handsome stone building completed in
1906.  The extensive records of Canadian history
under the able and courteous administration of
Dr. Arthur Doughty, Keeper of the Archives, are
made accessible to scholars and research students;
and this building has become one of the haunts of the
savant.  Numerous glass cases are filled with valuable
manuscripts and documents; historic souvenirs
abound; the library contains over twenty thousand
books; and there are many beautiful paintings
and engravings in the various rooms, illustrating
important epochs in the history of the Dominion and
also including many portraits of value and interest.

The Experimental Farm, three miles out of
Ottawa, covers nearly five hundred acres of land,
and it is one of the chief attractions, offering, as it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
does, so much efficient instruction in the seeding,
culture, and harvesting of agricultural products, and
the care of live stock.  Not far from this Farm is the
Royal Astronomical Observatory, built in Romanesque
style, with a central octagonal tower under
a revolving hemispherical dome, containing the
telescope.  The Observatory comprises an astronomical
library, photographic and lecture rooms, and a
reading-room.

Ottawa is a growing city and is one of the beautiful
capitals of the American continent with the
population now approaching the one hundred and fifty
thousand mark.  There is much of old-world
ceremony in the city.
</p>

<p>
Rideau Hall, the residence of the Governor-General
(at the time of writing, the Duke of Devonshire,
who succeeded His Royal Highness the Duke
of Connaught and Strathearn), is a rambling grey
stone structure, with ample grounds, comprising
some eighty-five acres.  The gracious character of
all ceremonial courtesies and hospitalities at Rideau
Hall are deeply appreciated by the people of the
Dominion.  The Duke of Devonshire is the head of
one of the greatest of English families, the
Cavendishes, and his appointment was a popular one with
Canadians.  The Duchess of Devonshire is the
daughter of a former Governor-General of Canada,
the Marquis of Lansdowne, and is no stranger to
Canada.
</p>

<p>
In an address given by the Duke of Connaught
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
before the Canadian Club, his Royal Highness thus
alluded to the position of Governor-General of the
Dominion:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"I do not know of a prouder position for any Englishman
to hold than that of his Majesty's representative as
Governor-General of Canada.  When my late brother, King
Edward the Seventh, asked me to accept this high post,
an offer which was renewed after his death by our present
gracious Sovereign, I felt great doubt as to whether I
could do justice to so high a position.  I had no doubt that
I should be a friend of the Canadians to-day as I was
forty-three years ago.  Since I have been in Canada the
last year and a half, I have felt more and more that I
have been able to gain the keen sympathy and, I venture
to say, the affection of the whole Canadian people.  I am
sure you will believe me when I say that I never spent a
happier year and a half.  To Englishmen who have not
been in Canada, I say the sooner they go the better.  It is
moving with leaps and bounds."
</p>

<p>
The Parliament Buildings occupy a commanding
site near the park in which the Château Laurier is
built, thus sharing the advantage of all the lovely
grounds.  The Rideau Canal, with its locks, joins the
Ottawa River in this park, under the very shadow
of Parliament, offering a picturesque feature as it
passes to the Rideau Lakes.  The extensive Library
of Parliament is, happily, open to the people, and its
generous hospitalities and rich resources have been
of themselves a signal attraction to scholars and
literary workers.  Fortunately the greater part of
this library escaped destruction in the fire of 1916
that partially destroyed the Parliament Buildings,
although as they will be restored with increased
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
facilities, the calamity was not wholly evil in its
results.
</p>

<p>
The Library of Parliament is built upon the lines
of some of the famous old chapter-houses in England
attached to a noble cathedral.  The interior is
circular, with a dome of forty-two feet in height, a
vaulted roof and rich carvings.  It is an interior rich
in the revelation of all that is best in the realm of
thought, all that touches human interests and makes
for those nobler ideals which are the real resources
of life.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the Parliament Buildings in the
early dawn has been celebrated by an Ottawa poet,
Duncan Campbell Scott:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Fair, in the South, fair as a shrine that makes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wonder of a dream, imperious Towers<br />
  Pierce and possess the sky, guarding the halls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where our young strength is welded strenuously;<br />
  While, in the East, the star of morning dowers<br />
  The land with a large tremulous light, that falls<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pledge and presage of our destiny."<br />

CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
TORONTO THE BEAUTIFUL
</h3>

<p>
Toronto, city of education, culture, religion; a
city of homes with all that makes for the beauty
and the happiness of family life; Toronto, with her
noble University whose enrolment of students exceeds
in number that of Oxford, her conservatories of
music, her impressive cathedrals and churches, her
splendid Parliament Buildings, and her classic Public
Library with its numerous branches&mdash;the capital of
the rich province of Ontario, this beautiful and
inspiring city of Canada provides, indeed, an ample
basis for the enthusiasm and devotion of her citizens.
No city could be more advantageously located,
seeing that she commands the blue waters of Lake
Ontario.  Toronto is the centre from which radiate
several of the most picturesque excursions into the
western continent.  The world-wonder of Niagara
Falls is in her near neighbourhood.  From Toronto
all the summer "playgrounds" of Canada may
be reached with the utmost convenience and
readiness; or the tourist may make that picturesque
sail down the St. Lawrence; or, again, would he be
like Wordsworth's <i>Stepping Westward</i>, he may take
train and embark at Sarnia for the tour of the
Great Lakes, ending at the terminal of Fort William,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
whence again he may wander into all the scenic
glories of Canada.
</p>

<p>
At Toronto the holiday-maker may board the
luxurious train for Huntsville, where he takes the
steamer for that idyllic cruise by the chain of lakes
that lands him at the fascinating Hotel Wawa; or
gives him access to any one of a myriad resorts in
the unique Lake-of-Bays region.  Algonquin Park,
the Muskoka Lakes, all these "Highlands of
Ontario" which are attracting throngs of summer
wanderers, are within easy reach of Toronto, to all
of which, indeed, the city is the gateway, and the
distributing centre as well.  The playgrounds of the
Dominion are much appreciated by the great nation
lying on her southern border.  New England and
the West have long been increasingly familiar with
the allurements of a Canadian summer; and now
the southern states, on and near the Gulf of Mexico,
are sending out for information of the facilities for
vacation sojourns amid the parks and lakes and
shining rivers of Canada.  Those far-famed Canadian
resorts, comprising not only the Lake of Bays,
Algonquin Park, and Muskoka, but Timagami, Kawartha
Lakes, French River, Lake Nipissing, and Georgian
Bay, all lie north of Toronto, and these resorts, some
of them over eighteen hundred feet above sea-level,
with their invigorating, balsam-laden air, are a
revelation to the visitor from the heated South.
</p>

<p>
The Southerner finds himself especially enthralled
by Canada's long summer days and lingering
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
twilights, with their ethereal and almost unearthly
beauty of amber lights and evanescent shadows, a
beauty that has hitherto been rather exclusively
associated with Scandinavia, the land of the midnight
sun.  What an hour for a twilight paddle across
some crystal lake, in turning homeward after an
idyllic day.  Canada has been fortunate in keeping
her wilds singularly unspoiled, for practically only
one railway line extends into all these romantic
regions, that of the Grand Trunk System, which has
been the means of the multiplication of delightful
summer hotels and rustic camps.  These Canadian
resorts (whose range of prices is so moderate as to
amaze the people from the States) are as socially
delightful as they are in scenic charm.  They are
characterised by the refinement of courtesy and
generous hospitality that is the hall-mark of the
Dominion.
</p>

<p>
Toronto is one of the most accessible centres of
the North American continent, being only three
hours from Buffalo, one night from New York and
Boston, and fourteen hours from Chicago.
</p>

<p>
Does all this enumeration of her charms only have
to do with getting away from them?  The citizen of
this beautiful city on the lake will assert that there
is another equally spellbinding range of charms to
be enjoyed without wandering far away from
Toronto itself.
</p>

<p>
The harbour of Toronto is one of the most beautiful
of any of the water-front cities.  It has a rather
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
curious configuration formed by a picturesque
island of more than two thousand acres that forms
a species of breakwater.  In the summer the waters
near the island are alive with craft.  Every kind of
sailing boat, canoes, and yachts, as well as motor
and steam launches, may be seen riding the waves.
The island itself is utilised in much the same fashion
as Coney Island in the New York harbour, as a
resort for popular amusement.  With this inland
sea of Lake Ontario at its doors, with its fine
architecture, its development and culture of the arts,
professions, and industries; with such picturesque
treasure as that of the Rosedale ravines, the Humber
valley, the Don River, and the gentle hills, Toronto
is well calculated to be one of the embodied
inspirations of the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
It is claimed that there are more homes, each
with its green lawn and its garden&mdash;homes owned
by their occupants&mdash;within the thirty-six square
miles that comprise Toronto than in any other
city on the American continent.  Toronto is truly
a thing of life in its expansion.  The construction of
streets and buildings is in constant progress and the
residential limits are being carried many miles into
the country.  Within the past decade the city has
crossed two rivers, marched up a hill, and clambered
over two ravines, all of which give the residential
region an aspect of romantic beauty.  The architectural
charm of the city impresses the stranger;
especially the cathedrals of St. James and St. Michael
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
and the University of Toronto, that great Norman
pile, dignified and with its old-world atmosphere.
Surrounding it are the colleges&mdash;Victoria, with its
Gothic dining-hall and residences; St. Michael's,
Knox, and Wycliffe.  Soon Trinity will join the ranks
of college settlements.  McMaster, the Baptist
University, is at the northern edge of the campus, and not
far away are the great medical schools, the School
of Science, the Conservatory of Music, the
University Library, the Dental College, and the many
college residences.  The University of Toronto is
perhaps the largest English-speaking University in
the British Empire, and the year 1916 found two
thousand five hundred of her sons fighting for the
Empire.  The Royal Ontario Museum, with its
Oriental and Indian collection, lies to the north
of the campus, and the great General Hospital as
well as a special hospital for children are adjacent.
Many of the churches are of real beauty&mdash;St. Paul's
Anglican, a structure which cost one and a half
million dollars; the Eaton Memorial on the hill;
the Metropolitan Methodist, owning ground estimated
as worth over two millions; and the parish
church of St. James, with its tower over three
hundred feet in height.  The Margaret Eaton School
of Literature and Expression is an institution of
great value, attracting students from all parts of
the Dominion.  As a theatrical and a musical city,
Toronto shares with New York, Boston, and
Montreal many of the most noted dramas and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
musical entertainments.  As a musical centre herself,
Toronto ranks fourth among the large cities of the
continent; and she has an annual average of four
thousand musical students.  Her own Mendelssohn
Choir is not only conceded to be the finest in America,
but one of the best in the world.
</p>

<p>
Nor are the graphic arts neglected in Toronto.
There are already two leading organisations, the
Ontario Society of Artists and the Canadian Art
Club.  A College of Art was founded in 1912; there is
a Women's Art Association, an Arts and Letters
Club, which has issued a very creditable Year Book
of Canadian Art, as well as a Heliconian Club,
composed of women engaged in artistic and literary
work, and who, presumably, quaff the living waters
of Helicon to reinforce their energies.
</p>

<p>
In her Public School System, with an enrolment
of thirty-five thousand pupils, Toronto employs
many of the most advanced educational methods
of the day.
</p>

<p>
If the visitor in Toronto were to ask for what is
perhaps the most really significant factor in the
city's life, and one which is likely to be missed by
the surface observer, the answer would be that
this factor would be found in the Public Library
System, so splendidly administered by the Chief
Librarian, George H. Locke.  A Canadian, a native
of Toronto, Mr. Locke was allured for a few years
by Harvard University and the University of
Chicago; but fortunately for his own city, he has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
chosen to devote himself to her development and
culture through the medium of library work, in a
manner whose original genius for relating literature
to the needs of the people, and more especially to
the youth and the children, is making itself felt in
the Dominion as well as in the city.
</p>

<p>
In many aspects of his manifold and remarkably
adjustable system, Mr. Locke creates his own
precedents.  In any survey of the processes in many
of the noted libraries of the past, the chief aim, if
not regarded as the chief duty, of the keeper of
books has seemed to be that of protecting them
from popular contact.  The books were to be
safeguarded from too familiar approach as are the works
of art in the great galleries and museums.  In every
case they did not, it is true, imitate the methods
of the Laurentian Library in Florence and chain
the books to the desks, but something of the spirit
of the stern custodian was in them all.  Mr. Locke
at once outlined his policy on the basis of his
conviction that books were made for the people, and
not the people for books, and that opportunities
for more knowledge and greater intelligence should
be provided.  More especially he held that books had
indispensable messages for the youth of a great
city.  The adult readers were welcomed and accorded
every possible opportunity and privilege; but the
children were not to be merely welcomed, they were
to be enticed by the very attractiveness of the
surroundings to come in from the highways and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
byways to the feast of literature provided so lavishly
for them.
</p>

<p>
Assisted by a staff of one hundred young
women whose enthusiasm leapt up to meet his
own, young women with wit and initiative of their
own as well, all of which their chief especially
encouraged on their parts, the work went forward.
"If you think you have a good plan," Mr. Locke
says, in effect, to his staff, "try it.  Don't come to
me about it.  If it is successful, then let us talk it
over.  If it is not, bury it quietly and don't put up
any monument to it."
</p>

<p>
The Central Library, with its fourteen branches,
works as a unit; yet not as the unit of a machine,
but in a unity of spirit and purpose inclusive of
many individual variations.  One feature of the
system of the highest value is that of the open
shelves.  Nothing so educates the child, in all that
most essential development of what Matthew Arnold
so well terms the humanities, as the habit of browsing
at will among books.  From the official report made
by Mr. Locke for the year 1915 the following
extract is taken, as it illustrates clearly one novel
and invaluable feature of the work&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The work with the children, which showed such a
remarkable increase last year, has shown even greater results,
and we see new possibilities for the coming year.  This
department is decidedly aggressive in its methods, and no
phase of public social service in this city has awakened
such wide interest.  The Story Hour, already popular, was
given a decided help onwards by the series of lectures
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
which the Children's Librarians arranged for during October
and November, when Miss Marie Shedlock, of London,
England, spoke to five delighted audiences on 'Story
Telling.'  That part of the Story Hour which is devoted to
Canadian historical characters is really a National
Movement, for it supplies to the children, many of whom are
of foreign parentage, a Canadian historical background,
something much needed in a new country with its great
problems to be solved by those who now are but children.
This year there were 12,671 children in the Story Hours
and 249,260 books were circulated among boys and girls."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The "Story Hour" is a semi-weekly feature of the
library work, and one which has developed
unmeasured ardour on the part of the youthful
auditors.
</p>

<p>
Another signally refining and helpful influence is
that of the culture of flowers; a garden plot, or
beds of flowers, being a feature of the grounds
surrounding each of the fourteen libraries.  The
children are encouraged to aid in this care of flowers,
and seats placed in the gardens enable summer
readers to pursue their work amid this beauty,
and in the invigorating air.
</p>

<p>
The "J. Ross Robertson Historical Collection,"
housed in the Reference Library, is as a gallery of
Canadiana of the utmost value to the student of the
history of the Dominion.  The collection numbers
already three thousand two hundred and twenty-nine
pictures, and in the year of 1915 alone, it
was visited by more than twelve thousand people.
These pictures tell the story of the development of
Canada from the forest, lake, and prairie, with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
tribes of wandering Red Men, into the land of
fruit, grain, and manufactures.  Mr. Robertson has
proved a real benefactor to the entire province as
well as the Dominion, for students come from all
parts of the country to study this collection.
</p>

<p>
Toronto is constructively much like London, in
that a number of separate communities are federated
to form one city.  In nearly every one of these
separate and component parts a branch of the
Public Library is established, taking the name of
the specific centre, such as Wychwood, Dovercourt,
and Yorkville.  The latest of these branches, that
at Wychwood, is a perfect architectural
reproduction of the Shakespearean period, thus
celebrating the tercentenary in 1916 in a tangible
manner, and its Elizabethan charm attracts numerous
appreciative visitors.  One typical instance of the
library spirit is that of taking a primitive and
discarded little church, fitting it up with books, and
with light and heat and flowers (for in every library
interior beautiful flowers are an unfailing ornament)
making of this a small branch in an undeveloped
part of the city, and forming it into a notable
centre of joy, helpfulness, and inspiration.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the University of Toronto, and in
close alliance with it, is University College, a state
institution, in which languages and the liberal arts
are taught; and this notable university system in
Toronto is inclusive of a number of other affiliated
institutions, in which the students may avail
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
themselves of the university examinations and degrees,
among which are the Toronto College of Music and
the Conservatory of Music.  There are four university
museums, the Mineralogical and the Geological, the
Archæological and the Biological; and there is also
a Gallery set apart for Palæontology.  A stately and
impressive building, the School of Domestic Science,
presented by Mrs. Massey Treble, is the centre of
instruction as useful as it is important.  No visitor
in the Dominion can fail to perceive how Canada
is especially a home-building, home-conserving
country.  If one were called upon to define the
Canadian nation in a phrase, it would be that
of a home-building people.  That the home,
in all the purity and sanctity of family life, is
the unit of civilisation is an article of faith in
Canada.
</p>

<p>
The Royal Astronomical Society of Toronto is an
association of much importance in the scientific
world.  In May, 1916, it had the honour of being
addressed by an astronomer whom it is no
exaggeration to term the most brilliant figure of the
age in interstellar physics.  This was Doctor Percival
Lowell, whose brilliant and original investigations
have thrown great light upon the evolution of the
planets, and whose especial discoveries (as they
may now be claimed) of the conditions on Mars
have arrested the attention of the entire scientific
world.  It was on this theme, including aspects of
Mars developed in observations made as recently
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
as in January and March of 1916, that Doctor Lowell
addressed the Society.[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn1text">1</a>] Dr. Percival Lowell died November 13, 1916, at Flagstaff
Observatory, Arizona, U.S.A.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The population of Toronto is already over the
half million mark, the city directory for 1915
recording a population of 534,000, and the number is
said to increase on an average of thirty thousand a
year.  It is a great manufacturing city, which has
been able to harness a waterfall, even the mighty
cataract of Niagara, into its daily service.  Is it that
the twentieth century calls from the fabled past
those genii and magicians who can command and
control the forces of Nature?  The result would
almost confirm that fascinating speculation.
Apparently the Torontian is more fortunate than
one individual who is said to have been enabled to
send the broomstick to fetch water, but forgetting
the incantation necessary to stop it, he was drowned.
Toronto apparently knows the secret of controlling
her almost unrivalled water-power.  There are in
and about Toronto more than nine hundred
factories that number over sixty-five thousand
employees, with an annual pay-roll of twenty-nine
millions, representing a capital of seventy-five
millions.  The electric power from Niagara Falls is
supplied at moderate rates, and thus the extension
of manufacturing plant is encouraged to the
advantage of the city itself.
</p>

<p>
The illumination of the Toronto streets by night is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
a feature of no little interest.  The use of
hydro-electric power has permitted the lighting by means
of cluster lights, a system of unique beauty and
incomparable service, and of great decorative effect
as well.  This power is supplied from the main station
located at Niagara Falls, on the Canadian side,
which itself is supplied directly from the cataract,
with a high voltage of electrical energy.
</p>

<p>
The annual Canadian National Exposition held in
Toronto during the last week in August and the first
in September is considered to be almost a barometer
of the progress of the world in general.  Its promoters
point with pride to the fact that this Exposition was
the first to introduce the dawn of the Electrical Age
to Canada; the first to introduce to general
knowledge Marconi's wireless telegraphy; the first to
demonstrate the uses of the telephone, and the
advantages of the electric car service, and has thus,
for a long series of years, made itself an important
factor of contemporary progress.

<p>
This Exposition is held in a natural park of some
two hundred and sixty acres, sloping from the blue
and sparkling waters of Lake Ontario, with a water
front of nearly two miles in extent.  The grounds are
made a very "garden-city," with wide, paved
streets and walks; with vistas of emerald turf
enriched with shrubs and flowering plants and trees,
amid which the permanent State buildings, graceful
and rich in architectural detail, reveal themselves
to great advantage.  This Exposition is justly held
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
throughout the Dominion as an annual focussing of
the latest inventions and appliances, as a gauge
of productive power in every direction, and it
draws over a million visitors to the city every
season.
</p>

<p>
As the Capital and metropolis of the rich and
important province of Ontario, Toronto can hardly
be adequately considered without some outline of
the activities of the Province as well.  The Parliament
buildings occupy a prominent site in the city, and
the Commissioners who are lodged in their various
departments represent every important industry
and interest in Ontario.  Among these interests are
the Good Roads Association, the Vegetable Growers,
the Game and Fisheries, and the Women's Institute
of Ontario, under the head of the Minister of Agriculture.
Ontario has its Agricultural College at Guelph
with the Macdonald Institute for girls in which
homemaking as well as housekeeping is taught and
which is the inspiration centre of the Women's
Institutes of the province.  The system of travelling
libraries is of unsurpassed aid in the disseminating
of information.  The Women's Institute and the
Farmers' Institute co-operate to the mutual
advantage of each.  Among the topics discussed in the
former are "Discipline for Children," "Problem
of the Farmer's Wife," "Furnishing a Living-room
for Comfort," "Old-Fashioned Hospitality,"
and "The Value of Pleasing Manners."  The activities
of this Institute radiate an influence and suggest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
a series of standards that is little less than invaluable
in its effect on the general rural life.  The Institute
has a membership of more than twenty-five thousand
women; they represent some eight hundred and
fifty branches; and their influence easily reaches
twice the number of the membership.  Courses of
lessons in Domestic Science are given in stated
centres; special instructors in cooking, dairying,
poultry-raising; and topics relating to household
labour of all kinds are assigned for discussion from
time to time, the meetings always drawing large and
eager audiences.  The entire instruction is eminently
practical, and in one Report made to the Minister
of Agriculture the programme of lessons offered
as typical included "Invalid Cookery," "Table
Seating and Serving," "How to Spend the Winter
Evenings," and "Wholesome Reading for Boys
and Girls."  It will readily be seen how extremely
valuable is such a range of discussion as this, in a
comparatively new country, where each household
must so largely depend upon its own resources.
"The strength of the Empire is in the homes of her
people," said one lecturer, and the opinion is
wide-spread.  This Association further urges that its
prevailing spirit shall know no distinction of class
or creed; that it shall reach and include, with
cordial, gracious welcome, every woman who is
inclined to come into it.  The motto of the Institute
is, "If you know a good thing, pass it on."  The
Ontario Vegetable Growers' Association is another
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
energetic organisation, whose aim is to "plant and
make things grow."
</p>

<p>
The importance of social welfare is very fully
recognised in Canada.  "We are not here simply to
make a living, to spend all our days in work," states
one leading member; "we are here to enjoy life,
and I believe that God intended that every one
should enjoy a well-rounded life, with time for
recreation and for mental and spiritual development."
</p>

<p>
In the prominence given to social service in the
Dominion, a new and distinctive profession is opened,
and one especially fitted for educated and cultivated
young women.  Various spheres of work are open,
as those of assistants to city pastors, and as nurses,
park attendants, health inspectors, police matrons,
school inspectors, and as officials in the many
charitable and educational institutions.  Friendly
visiting is not the least of these many channels for
aid to social betterment, and for the extension of
sympathies and the promotion of the higher life.

CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE CANADIAN SUMMER RESORTS
</h3>

<p>
Canada is Nature's pleasure-ground.  The ineffable
spell of beauty enchants the entire Dominion.  It is
not difficult to recognise the sources of her poets'
inspirations.  The wanderer in all this bewildering
loveliness can say with the singer:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I bathe my spirit in blue skies<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taste the springs of life."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
How Lampman has painted the very atmosphere
in the lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I lift mine eyes sometimes to gaze,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning skyline blinds my sight;<br />
  The woods far off are blue with haze;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills are drenched in light."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Never was there beauty of Nature that so transmuted
itself into vitality.  The air is the very elixir
of life.  It is the infinite reservoir from which untold
measures of energy may be drawn and stored up for
the future.  One does, indeed, "taste the springs of
life" in actual experience.
</p>

<p>
The colossal scale of the summer resorts of Canada
suggests the haunts of the Titans.  The Maritime
Provinces have long been a recognised locality for
vacation days; but the region of central Canada,
from Lake-of-Bays and Algonquin Park to Minaki,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
on the lakes east of Winnipeg, opens a new
world to the summer visitor.  It invites the seeker
after health, rest, sport, or artistic enjoyment; it
offers ideal conditions for the writer or the student,
as well; but all this terrestrial paradise requires a
clearly-defined geographical presentation in order
to be at all adequately comprehended.  In a country
stretching over three thousand seven hundred miles
from coast to coast; and in which the pleasure
grounds already opened to easy accessibility by rail
or steamer are thousands of miles in extent, a clear
idea of their relative aspects in geographical space
is an initial requirement.  Canada is a Wonderland,
but she is not an untraced wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, Lake-of-Bays!  Poetic,
bewitching, star-crowned Wawa!  The instant devotion
inspired by this fascinating fairyland is, like beauty,
its own excuse for being.  As the visitor steps, in
the brilliant sunshine of a late afternoon, upon the
beach at Norway Point he finds himself within
two hundred yards of the hotel.  Here is a splendid
dock with shelter rooms and baggage rooms, and
here are porters from the Wawa, and his
impedimenta having been handed over he turns to look
at the oncoming sunset over the lake and over
wooded islands, the colour-scheme changing in the
flitting, opalescent lights, the cloud-shadows drifting
over the green of island trees and vegetation, with a
fringe of pine and balsam along the shores of the
lake offering their refreshing shade for the saunterers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
and the bathers.  The dancing pavilion is not far
away at one end of the long piazza, and strains of
music from the orchestra are floating out on the
wonderful air.  On a plot of verdant grass a group
of white-robed children are dancing like a very fairy
ring; and the western sky which the Wawa fronts is
aglow with the sunset splendours.
</p>

<p>
Or, perchance, one arrives in the morning (for
there are three steamers a day) in the pure,
transparent light which plays such optical tricks with
distance.  There may be illusions similar to those
that beset, and delight, the visitors to the Grand
Canyon in Arizona.  One stands on the brink of that
titanic chasm and seeing an enticing point apparently
close at hand he remarks that he will just step over
to it.  "How far do you think it is?" questions the
habitué with secret delight; "that point is two
miles away from us," he continues with due enjoyment
in his companion's discomfiture.  Something of
the same illusions of the air beset one at Norway
Point, on which the Wawa stands.  This point is a
favourite with an increasing number of summer
colonists as the numerous cottages and picturesque
camps suggest.
</p>

<p>
Not the least of a summer's enjoyment here is the
charm of the trip.  It is very easy, but it is also very
picturesque.  North from Toronto at a distance of
some hundred and forty-six miles is the pretty
little village of Huntsville, nestled among lakes
and hills.  Here begins the Lake-of-Bays region.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
The locality is one of the loveliest in Ontario;
the lakes are dotted with islands and connected
by winding rivers, with luxuriant growth of
woodlands; the surface of the water is covered with
lilies, the hills are dark with their sombre pines,
and the entire landscape is fascinating.  At this
point the traveller is transferred from the
railway to the waiting steamer on which he gaily
steps for a sail on this unique series of lakes.
The steamer glides to the end of one and enters a
river; and the craft pushes on through it while
branches of trees and tangled vines sway so near, on
either side, that they may be almost grasped by the
hand.  What will happen next? one mentally
questions.  How will a steamer ever thread this
wildwood?  For apparently there is but an unmarked
stretch of woodlands ahead, and even the steam
launch of an enchanted journey can hardly be
expected to navigate forests.  Like most difficulties,
however, this one comes to a satisfactory solution
when another lake that has concealed itself behind a
grove is now revealed and the steamer sails on.
</p>

<p>
But when she meets solid land how is she to
negotiate the portage?  It is then that the genius of
the lamp appears, which one has but to rub in order
to attain to the realisation of any of his earthly
desires, and the touch on the lamp, as Aladdin holds
it up for the passengers, produces, not the Amazon
nor yet the Mississippi, but a mile of railroad, the
shortest railroad in the world, bridging the portage
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
between the lakes.  Into the cars throng the
passengers for the swift transit around the hills to the
lake and the other steamer waiting.  "Lake-of-Bays,"
indeed!  Lake of a myriad bays, for the
entire shores are indented with the inlets bordered
by firs that mirror themselves in the water.  It is
through all this shining pathway that the tourist
makes his triumphal progress and arrives at length
at Norway Point.  When one realises that all this
Wonderland is, after all, only nine hours from
Buffalo, one sees how easily accessible from the
States are Canada's most charming summer districts.
The romantic journey would almost be worth the
taking even if one remained but a single night.  For
the beautiful hours of life are not over when they
have passed; they linger in memory; they pervade
all the quality of life.
</p>

<p>
It is in the climate that the very concentration
of vitality lies, and a night's sleep at Norway Point
seems to transform one's entire being with a renewal
of life.  What a view it is at night from the upper
piazza when the powerful searchlight of the hotel
is turned over lakes and woods and clustered
islands; and the evening steamer coming in, gay
with flags and pennons, with snatches of music
and light laughter borne on the evening air.  The
searchlight on the hotel, the lights on the boat,
flash their signals back and forth.  For a moment
the visitor is again on the Swiss lakes where boats
and inns call to each other in signals of light.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
For some years past the custom, familiar to the
sojourners in Geneva, Lucerne, and Vevey, has
been adopted as one of the novel and amusing
features at the Wawa.  Of all the fair lands ever
dreamed, is that which is revealed (or is it half
created?) under the swiftly moving wave of light,
that flashes its high illumination over the lakes, near
and far, that gleam like silver.  The searchlight
brings out the forests in their dark and massive
shadows, revealing, too, the numbers of little boats
and canoes, with their firefly lights, dotting the lake.
</p>

<p>
Behind the hotel there rises a densely wooded
bluff, some two hundred feet high, from whose
summit alluring views attract the lingerer on the
hillside.  On this height is the reservoir that supplies
the hotel, the altitude giving great momentum to
the running water.  The grounds comprise some
three hundred acres&mdash;everything is on a generous
scale in Canada&mdash;and over these grounds are scattered
pergolas and rustic seats that offer their enticing
ease to the strollers in the open air, who perhaps
agree with Walt Whitman that it is in open space
in which "all heroic deeds are conceived, and all
great poems, also."
</p>

<p>
It is not surprising that hotels and cottages spring
up around these lakes, and that campers find here a
favourite haunt.  An immense new hotel, the Bigwin
Inn, has been completed on Bigwin Island, the
enterprise of one of the foremost citizens of Ontario.
The Bigwin is something novel in design, the dining-hall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
occupying one building (with entrancing piazzas
and balconies towards the lake) while other
buildings house the private rooms for the guests, the
Social Hall, Office, and dancing pavilion, though
all these are connected by covered corridors.  The
Bigwin will be one of the greatest summer hotels
on the continent, and its establishment is one
of the evidences of the increasing popular
recognition of the charm and beauty of the Lake-of-Bays
country.  The hotel is picturesquely situated
on Bigwin Island, a tract of two-and-a-half miles
in length, densely wooded, and with easy approach.
The swift communication rendered possible
between The Bigwin and The Wawa, by means of
motor boats and steam launches, will enhance the
enjoyment of each.  The new hotel will be a temple of
festivities and gaiety.  The dancing pavilion has every
late luxury of device for the dancers, and for those
interludes of "sitting out" a dance for which the
revel itself is made.  There are palm corners; there
are balconies overhanging the waters until one might
well believe himself in Venice; and there are supper
rooms, card tables, and provision for necessary
music as well as for the onlookers.
</p>

<p>
The steamers of the Lake-of-Bays Navigation
Company will make the Bigwin one of their ports
of call, thus assuring a triple service every day, and
rendering easy all arrivals and departures.  The
steamer-landing is near the hotel, and the entire
island furnishes the grounds for the Inn.  The pretty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
Italian custom of building the dining-rooms of the
hotel so as to overhang the water is one of the
noteworthy features of the Bigwin.  At Bertolini's, in
Naples, a similar effect is attained by the glass-enclosed
terrace, in the air, so much in use for afternoon
teas and festive occasions.  At the Bigwin the
<i>salle-a-manger</i> actually projects by some feet above
the water, and its circular form and artistic
architectural design render it a unique spectacle from
the decks of the steamers as they traverse the lake.
The Inn, which will open at the end of the War, will
accommodate six hundred guests.
</p>

<p>
The evolution of summer resorts would alone
make up almost a social history of the past three-quarters
of a century.  It is a far cry to the days
when, in the United States, Saratoga and Niagara
Falls, with a small contingent at Newport, held
the exclusive fashionable prestige for summer life.
New England had its North Shore, to which Boston
largely transferred itself when the summer opened.
The White Mountains have always retained their
clientele composed for the most part of people to
whom the seclusion and pure air ministered rather
to the carrying on of their studious pursuits than to
the abandonment of them.  Newport came to have
a formidable rival in Bar Harbour.  The opening
of luxurious railway facilities to the Far West, and
the provision of beautiful hotels in Colorado, at the
Grand Canyon, in California, the Yellowstone Park,
and other localities have made all those regions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
a land of summer.  There are few, now, that are not
familiar to the travelling public, and so the
unparalleled summer resorts of Canada open a new range
of attractions and experiences.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the two dominating hotels, the Wawa
and the Bigwin, the Lake-of-Bays offers numerous
other centres for vacation days in smaller hotels,
cottages, and camps.  Grunwald, perched on the
west shore of Lake Mary; Dwight Bay, Point
Ideal, Bona Vista, Britannia, and many other
inviting nooks are discovered.
</p>

<p>
And when the season at enchanting Wawa is
over?  Then, again, the sail through Peninsula
Lake, through Fairy River and Fairy Lake, to
the wharf at Huntsville again, where the train
awaits the traveller.  Alas! for the perfection of
connections.  One has no excuse for lingering
longer.  Yet so early in the September days, to many
sojourners the best of the season is yet to come.
North of the Lake-of-Bays is Algonquin Park.
This government reservation of nearly two million
acres, with the comfortable and commodious Highland
Inn perched on a high terrace looking out on
another of the great lakes over the islands and dense
woodlands, is to many visitors the most alluring
place for out-of-door life in the whole of Canada.
The Highland Inn offers much that is not set
down on the bills.  To find in this sportsman's
paradise hotel accommodations that satisfy the
typical demands of twentieth-century civilisation;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
to find homelike rooms, with books and papers
and magazines in plentiful profusion; with a
writing-desk well stocked with stationery near one's
elbow at every turn; spacious piazzas on which to
dream; an hotel under the same management as
the palatial Château Laurier, the magnificent Fort
Garry in Winnipeg, and the hardly less imposing
Macdonald in Edmonton&mdash;to find these things is to
be at once assured of the perfection of every detail.
The traveller, only too ready to take the goods
the gods provide, accepts this felicitous dispensation
as a part of the boundless benevolences of the
universe.  If he is a sportsman, the world is indeed
at his feet.  He may secure his canoe and his guide
and fish all day in any one of the many lakes; as
there are two thousand in all, he may be said to
have a range of choice.  In the life-giving air, two
thousand feet above sea level, he may enjoy
indefinitely long tramps, studying, at close range, the
wild animals in the Park.  For more than twenty
years they have been protected from harm by the
law that forbids carrying firearms within the
reservation limits; and the mink, the beaver, an almost
innumerable variety of birds, with squirrels and the
graceful and friendly deer are found in abundance
in Algonquin Park.  The camp sites are unsurpassed
and the hospitalities of the campers are as ready
as they are ample.  The gypsy kettle is always swung,
the camp fire is burning, and the lovely nymphs
of the lake and woodland who flit about in picturesque
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
garb are ready to offer the impromptu guest
almost any order of refreshment at a moment's
notice.
</p>

<p>
The true camper, like the poet, is born and not
made.  It is an instinct, a gift, a grace, to adapt
oneself to the simple life of the woodlands, which is,
however, not without its creature comforts.  Lady
campers may invite one, with traces of housewifely
pride, to glance at the interior of their spotless
tents; an interior little used save for sleep or for
shelter in sudden storms.  They take pride in the
beds of springy balsam well covered by blankets;
and the little tables with a few books and a chair
or two.  A bed of balsam boughs; a breakfast of
trout freshly caught in the lake, with coffee made
over the camp fire, combined with youth and health
and keen interest in the world in general, and what
more could one ask?  And if one is not acclimated
to the system of domestic life as ordered by the
livers in the open air, then he may enjoy in the
Highland Inn all the regulation viands and appointments
of the highest civilisation, with his breakfast
of grape-fruit, cereals, delicious coffee not made
over a camp fire; trout, hot cakes, and the wonderful
maple syrup of the land of the Maple Leaf.
With these he will have his matutinal paper, with
the latest news of the universe, that has come up
from Toronto at night, and for the day before him
relays of attractions, each more delightful than the
other, beckon to him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the vast woodlands one may encounter many
happy couples strolling, not invariably side by side,
for there is no surplus space beyond the width
required for the single pedestrian.  As they fare
forth in true Indian file, He calls to Her, "Come
on"; or occasionally, by way of special conversational
brilliancy, he exclaims in a friendly tone,
"Are you there?"  They are possibly making their
way over a portage.  The guide has the canoe,
reversed, on his head.  As they wind along intricate
paths, He goes in advance, and She faithfully
follows.  There is all the charm of conversational
entertainment when He looks sideways over his
shoulder and exclaims, "Getting on all right?"  She
would be ashamed to confess she was not!
When their canoe-trip was projected that morning
She, who did not know a canoe from a constellation,
was quite in rapture.  As a tenderfoot, as yet
unprofited by the proximity of the wilderness, She
descended from her bower equipped with a parasol for
the sun, an umbrella for possible rain, a handbag
duly supplied with pencil, notebook, violet water,
and various feminine conveniences; a volume of her
favourite poet in her hand that He may read aloud
to her, and a novel for her own private delectation,
in case He should be oblivious of poetic ecstasies
and like a mere man prefer to smoke and ... dream.
But He, who has seen the wilderness before
in the course of his august career, and to whom
canoeing is no mystery, regards Her with unaccustomed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
severities and austerities.  "You can't take
those things," he laconically observes, with one
finger designating her numerous impedimenta;
"upset the canoe."  Poet and novelist, to say nothing
of lace-trimmed parasol, are banished; and She
receives the first intimation of an idea that there
is some necessity of equilibrium connected with
canoeing.
</p>

<p>
Between the two extremes of the campers in the
open and the guests of the Highland Inn, Algonquin
Park offers another mode of living that has caught
the fancy of the public.  This is the provision made
by two log cabin camps which the Grand Trunk
System has built in picturesque places in the Park.
Nominigan Camp ("camp amid the balsams") is
seven miles from the Highland Inn, and is reached
either by the stage, which makes the trip every day,
or by the more romantic way of canoeing over
the lakes, and walking over the connecting
portages.  The site of Nominigan Camp is one worth
going far to see.  On the shore of one of the most
beautiful lakes it was ever the happiness of man
to behold, with a vista of hills and woodlands,
the spot is wildly beautiful.  And the camp itself;
imagine a large central log house with abundance
of rooms, and great fireplaces in which to burn
logs and sit and wonder; with radiator heating
also, and electric light, and bathrooms with running
water; with a large dining-room and admirable
food; with a great salon where every one may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
gather; and with several log cottages adjacent
where families or parties, or the single traveller,
can have sleeping rooms, coming to the central
house for meals; the high standards of comfortable
and refined life maintained and yet offering this
idyllic freedom&mdash;could there be a more inviting
combination?  It is no wonder that an eminent
guest who had passed some time at Nominigan
wrote:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"To put a camp of this kind deep in the heart of the
wilderness, and touch the wild life of the forest and lake
with a most acceptable bit of civilisation in the form of
grate fires, running water, bath-tubs, and inside toilet
arrangements is decidedly a feat worthy to be spoken of
when summer resorts are mentioned.  To likewise supply
a crowd of seventy-five guests with such an excellent table
as we found provided for us, and to serve it so acceptably
as to make one for a moment forget that he was beyond
the bounds of civilisation, was likewise a feat of which the
management should be proud."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Lady Conan Doyle
were guests at Nominigan in the summer of 1914,
and the creator of "Sherlock Holmes" proved to be
as ingenious in entering into the diversions of the
locality as he is in the field of romance he has made
so especially his own.  Lady Conan Doyle, who
developed a genuine gift for fishing, caught an eight
pound salmon trout.  Equal in beauty is Camp
Minnesing ("Island Camp") on the shore of
Island Lake.
</p>

<p>
Between the Highland Inn and the Nominigan
and Minnesing camps there is daily stage connection,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
and it is thus easy to unite both the comfortable
living in a well-ordered hotel, in touch with
daily papers and several daily mails, with constant
excursions into the wild territory, with canoeing,
fishing, or walks and tramps through the interminable
forests.  Of all the Canadian parks, Algonquin
Park is the most accessible from the United States
and Eastern Canada.  At the Algonquin Park
station one may take a train in the morning for
Rock Lake, a distance of twelve miles, where there
is a famous fishing region for black bass, and where
boats and canoes and all necessary outfit may be
obtained.  In Cache Lake the black bass also abound.
At White Lake are salmon trout, and a canoe trip
over one or two other of the smaller lakes brings
the angler to Little Island Lake, noted for its
speckled trout.  But there are some two thousand
lakes in the Park, so your choice of fishing grounds
is unlimited.
</p>

<p>
Not the least among the interests of a sojourn in
Algonquin Park is a visit to the home of
Mr. G. W. Bartlett, the Superintendent of the Park, whose
house is within a stone's throw of the Highland
Inn.  Among his treasures is a remarkably fine
collection of wild animals and birds, prepared by the
art of the taxidermist, and the government of Ontario
has also inaugurated a "Zoo," which has already
a small collection and which will be constantly
increased.
</p>

<p>
The amateur photographer finds great interest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
in this Park as the animals, accustomed only to
kindness, are easily approached, and the "bits" of
forest scenes, of silver-shining waters, of giant
rocks jutting out from the hillside, offer unlimited
material for the artist to compose.  Landscapes for
the asking surprise the eye; and if Algonquin Park
is the more obviously and more familiarly known
as the sportsman's paradise, it is none the less the
happy hunting-ground of the artist.  The colour
effects are something with which to conjure.  The
scarlet glow of the sunsets suddenly make a towering
rock seem to leap into the air to a height undreamed
of; while over the still, solemn pine trees the sky
turns to flame; rocks and jutting hillsides take on
the effect of colossal sculptures; the clouds resolve
themselves into spectral angels watching over the
world, and the forests take on a grace of line that
holds the gazer with its wonderful spell of beauty.
</p>

<p>
From June until into September the days are
long in the Algonquin Park country; they dawn in
rose and wane in gold.  The air is all vitality with
its filtering through millions of acres of pine and
balsam and spruce; the sunshine of the days is
radiant; the moonlit nights are cool.  Wandering
through Algonquin woodlands one seems to hear
borne on the air the poet's haunting lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Along the sky, in wavy lines,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er isle and reach and bay.<br />
  Green-belted with eternal pines,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains stretch away.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Below, the maple masses sleep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shore with waters blends,<br />
  While midway on the tranquil deep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening light descends."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This wonderful Park is very popular for its summer
camps for girls and for boys, located on the lakes
in close contact with the hotels.  Here young people
can be sent under the supervision of college men and
women, thus enjoying all the freedom and wild
charm of the summer life with every protection and
safeguard thrown about them.  Camp Minne-Wawa
is one of these; a summer camp for boys and young
men established in 1911 by Dr. Wise, of the Chair
of English Language and Literature at the Bordentown
Military Institute, New Jersey, assisted by a
staff of notable educators.  The aim of this culture
is described as that of "Right Thinking and
Character Building."  The Minne-Wawa is on the
Lake of Two Rivers in the southern portion of the
park.  The trains make a special stop for this camp;
and the tents, all on raised platforms, with the
natural life, the physical and intellectual training,
and the careful supervision of Doctor and Mrs. Wise;
with the provision, too, that the selection of
applicants is restricted to those whose conduct is that of
gentlemen&mdash;all these conditions render this a
valuable and interesting feature of vacation life in
Algonquin.
</p>

<p>
The Timagami region is one of great scenic beauty
and it is also of special interest to the geologist.
Through rail service from Buffalo to the station of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
Timagami renders the journey an easy one from the
States, while the district is also in still closer touch
with Toronto.  The lakes and the surrounding hills
are of the Laurentian formation.  There is very little
disintegration, and therefore little mud or sand.
There is rock; there is water; and very little shading
between.  The crystal clearness of the water is famous,
and one can gaze into it for a depth of from twenty-five
to thirty-five feet.  The atmosphere is so clear
and dry that conversations can be carried on over a
mile of distance.  The echo phenomena all about
these islands rivals that of the Leaning Tower of
Pisa, or as under the dome of the Taj Mahal.
"Anywhere between the islands you can get as many as
six distinct repetitions of the echo," writes an
<i>habitué</i>, and adds:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Some August night when the moon is sailing through
fleecy clouds and the planets shine like points of light in
the crystal depths below your canoe, let a clear baritone
voice roll out a flood of song among Timagami's islands,
and you might think the gods themselves had awakened,
and that every rock and islet was the home of some musical
spirit voicing the theme of the night in a thousand silvery,
reverberating melodies."

Very engaging is all this country of the Highlands
of Ontario made so easy of access.  Allandale (always
associated with its alluring lunch-room), Barrie,
the pretty town on a crescent of Kempenfeldt Bay,
busy Orillia, with its numerous beautiful residences,
on to Gravenhurst at the foot of Lake Muskoka,
the journey is one of perpetual delight.  Muskoka
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
wharf is but a mile from Gravenhurst, and the trains
run directly to the steamer.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian lakes are a marvel in themselves.
The entire country is literally and lavishly strewn
with them.  Their abundance modifies the climate
perceptibly.  They range from lakes 300 miles long
and 600 feet deep to the small lakelets hidden
away in the trackless forests.  There are at least nine
lakes more than 100 miles long, and there are more
than thirty-five over fifty miles long.  Many of these
are still further elongated by the bays that indent
their shores, and they are so connected by rivers that
almost continuous canoeing for scores of miles is
sometimes practicable, with only occasionally a
mile or two of portage.  In connection with such a
multitude of lakes there are some very interesting
geological facts.
</p>

<p>
In the Muskoka region there are more than one
hundred hotels, from the Royal Muskoka, accommodating
three hundred guests, to those of the simplest,
yet entirely comfortable order that can receive only
fifteen or twenty guests with prices often as low as
six dollars a week.  The month of September in the
Muskoka Lakes is particularly delightful.  It is
estimated that there is an annual transient summer
population of not less than thirty thousand every
year of people from both the States and the
Dominion.  Many of the romantic islands in the lakes
are owned by wealthy people who have built
charming summer villas upon them.  There are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
between four and five hundred of these islands, the
largest of which consists of over eleven hundred
acres, and on many of which any one is at liberty
to build.  The generous attitude of the Ontario
Government is always a fact with which to reckon.
There are very beautiful places in this Muskoka
district: the "River of Shadows" (apparently a
subterranean forest, so perfectly is every leaf and
branch mirrored in the water), the Moon River, and
the Falls of Bala.  It is of the strange, wild beauty of
Muskoka that Lampman wrote:
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When silent shadows darken from the shores,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all thy swaying fairies over floors<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, out of magic bays,<br />
  The yells and demon laughter of the loon<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startle the hills and raise<br />

<p class="poem">

All these Highlands of Ontario are a part of the
vast Laurentian range and they are characterised
by a singular type of rugged and stately beauty.
They are densely wooded; and the luxuriant maples
in all their golden-green, that wonderfully vivid
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
emerald with a hint of gold caught from the sunshine
in the summer, and their brilliant scarlet and amber
in the early autumn; the fragrant balsams; the
giant hemlocks; the tall pines that almost lead one
to question George Eliot's assertion that "Care is
taken that the trees do not grow into the sky," for
the Canadian pine seems almost to pierce the sky&mdash;all
this marvel of forest, with the shining lakes and
sunlit glades, renders the Highlands of Ontario one of
the wonders of the world.  From Buffalo and Toronto
to North Bay on Lake Nipissing, this entire region
is traversed by the Grand Trunk System carrying
summer wanderers through this enchanting scenery&mdash;hills,
and lofty peaks, and woods, variegated with
the silver expanse of lakes and flowing rivers; and if,
perchance, one is travelling by night, it is rather
delightful to raise the heavy curtain of the large
window of a Pullman sleeper and watch the stars,
and the sky, and the often weird effects of chiaroscuro.
They not unfrequently suggest artistic creations.
By night or by day it is all a spellbinding land,
the celestial heavens glittering by night, the
sunshine flooding the world with illumination by day;
and silver mists, and ethereal shadows lurk in the
deep pinewoods.  To the initiate there are magic
guides in all these haunts, unseen save of him who
hath the "spirit-gifted eyes."  The light of all the
constellations that have ever looked down on earth
since the morning-stars sang together is in these
Canadian skies.  For always is it true that

<p class="noindent">
Not only the romance of Canada, but the tangible
realities of her prosperity are disclosed to the eye of
the traveller.  Farms in a high state of cultivation;
comfortable, alluring farmhouses, with their lawns,
and gardens, and parterres of flowers, and a rustic
seat here and there are in continual evidence.
The refinements of life, from the neatness and grace
of rural homes to the beautiful little railway stations
with their attractive architecture, their plots of
greenery, their brilliant beds of flowers, are
impressive to the onlooker, and do more to convey to
travellers a true concept of the character of the
Canadian people than can be fully estimated.  The
gratification of one's sense of beauty in these
charming little way stations along the route adds
immeasurably to the enjoyment of the journey.

Then, too, what can be said of that sail among
the thirty thousand islands in the Georgian Bay?
In colour and idyllic charm this sail rivals the famous
cruise among the Ionian Islands:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where burning Sappho loved and sung,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and all the summer resorts of this region,
Minnecoganashene, Sans Souci, Rose Point, and various
nooks of verdant charm are peopled by their summer
lovers.
</p>

<p>
The Great Lakes, shared alike by the Dominion
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
and the States, offer a delightful cruise between
Sarnia (Ontario) and Duluth (Minnesota) with calls
at Fort William and Port Arthur, and a further
excursion to the Falls of Kakabeka, a cascade
higher than that of Niagara, which are near Port
Arthur.

<p>
Lake Nipissing and the French River are attractive
grounds for the camper and the canoeist; but
they are not suited to the "tenderfoot."  It is
amazing that a region which can be reached with
ease is yet so absolutely a place where the lover
of Nature in her wild solitudes can absolutely secure
a vacation from relentless Time!  In the Lake
Nipissing land he may elude the postman and the
telephone.  Doubtless by 1920, some invading airship
will drop a voluminous mail at his feet when he is
out in his canoe; but at the present time the
sojourner here is immune from cables, telegrams,
Marconigrams, long-distance telephones, special
deliveries, messenger boys, and all this incubus of
what we call civilisation.  If radiograms fall upon
him they must needs come from the solar system
alone.  Emerson, even in the prehistoric period of
the nineteenth century, declared solitude a thing
impossible to find.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When I would spend a lonely day<br />
  Sun and moon are in my way,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he complains.  The lingerer camping out on the
French River has no green-shaded electric reading-lamp
at his elbow; no electric bell summons his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
servitor.  He "catches" his breakfast in the deep
waters of the lake; he concocts his matutinal coffee
over a camp-fire.  No ingenious victrola enchants
his evening with the lyric melody of Melba or
Caruso; but instead, the strange cry of the loon
echoes startlingly through the silences.  And so it
falls out that the hardy devotees of the chase and
the camp hail this region as their El Dorado.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the Nipissing, Timagami, as before noted,
may be considered to be the earthly paradise of
those to whom the necessities of life consist in the
modern luxuries; those who would quite sympathise
with John Lothrop Motley; who remarked that if he
had the luxuries of life he could get on very well
without the necessities.
</p>

<p>
Nibigami, "country of lakes," is a new outing
ground in Canada now made accessible by the
Canadian Government Railways; and all this
hitherto unknown wilderness is enlisting the
devotion of thousands of hunters, of fishermen, and
hardly less of the artist and student.
</p>

<p>
Three hours east of Winnipeg is Minaki, the
"Beautiful Country" of the Indians, at which
station passengers may disembark to step into a
steam launch for a sail of twenty minutes to Minaki
Inn.  This is a large and charmingly appointed hotel,
accommodating three hundred and fifty guests,
with its annex, Minaki Lodge, affording rooms for
seventy-five in addition, located in a natural park
of fourteen acres, every room having its own outlook
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
over lakes or woodlands.  With its spacious piazzas,
its artistic furnishing, its admirable management, it
is little wonder that the Minaki Inn has leapt into
popular favour, not only for season guests, but also
for travellers en route for the Canadian Rockies, for
Jasper and Mount Robson Parks, or Prince Rupert,
and for all those who find the Minaki a restful place
at which to break the journey.  The hotel is woodland
embowered and lake mirrored.  It is supremely
comfortable.
</p>

<p>
Around the lakes on which the Inn is placed is a
large and constantly increasing number of cottages,
very artistic in architectural detail, built by wealthy
people of Winnipeg and elsewhere for their summer
homes.  They are by no means primitive in
construction; the latest devices in heating, lighting,
and household conveniences as well as luxurious
furnishings are in evidence; and at night from the
piazzas and balconies of the hotel the circle of these
friendly illuminations around the lakes is fascinating
to the gazer.

View in Jasper Park
</p>

<p>
Jasper Park, lying west of Edmonton, in the foothills
of the Rockies, is another National reservation
included among the Playgrounds of Canada; and
it has an area half as large as that of the kingdom
of Belgium, comprising some 4400 square miles.
The Government will keep this in its natural state
for all future time, so that, as the country becomes
more settled, and the features peculiarly Canadian
become obliterated, Jasper Park may reveal to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
coming generations the nature of the primæval
wilderness.  Jasper Park is invested with historic
interest, as it was the scene of the fierce commercial
conflicts between the Hudson's Bay and the North-West
Trading Companies.  It is also rich in Indian
legend and tradition.
</p>

<p>
Jasper Park is, however, not filled with game as
is Algonquin.  It is said that a century ago it teemed
with bear, mink, beaver, elk, and caribou&mdash;but since
that time the resident Indians have devastated the
animal life; and when they learned that the
Dominion was about to take over the entire tract
for a permanent reservation, they embarked upon
a wholesale slaughter of the animals.  The Park is
now made by Government decree a safe and friendly
region for the wild game, and it is thus confidently
hoped to gradually increase the animal life of the
preserve.
</p>

<p>
The flora of the Park is so varied and so unusual
as to make it an important locality to the botanist.
Not only is there an infinite variety of flowers, many
of which are not found elsewhere on the continent,
the aquilegia, the mampanula, the moon-daisy, and
endless variations on the chrysanthemum; but also
the strange grasses, mosses, lichens, and curious
shrubs, all combine to enlist and hold the curiosity
of the student of nature.
</p>

<p>
The steel highway has brought this Alpine region,
on the western border of Alberta, into easy and
swift connection with the travelling world.  Already
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
the Grand Trunk Pacific is projecting hotels of the
same exceptional character as those with which
Algonquin Park is so well provided.  At present
there is the unique feature of a "tent city," which
renders a sojourn of any length one that is entirely
comfortable and provisioned with the amenities of
life.  It is one to rather enhance, indeed, the ordinary
experiences of travel.  The sleeping tents (as
separate as rooms in an hotel) are all fitted with
board floors and are equipped with comfortable beds
and every convenience.  There is a large central
marquee for the dining-room, and all this comfort,
to say nothing of glories of scenery undreamed of,
is offered at the almost nominal rate of two and a
half dollars a day.  The town site commands a
magnificent view of Athabasca Valley.  The Athabasca
river expands, at intervals, into lakes, of which
Brule Lake, Jasper Lake, and Fish Lake are notable.
At the juncture of the Athabasca and the Maligne
rivers stood formerly the headquarters of the
North-Western Fur Company; while the old Jasper House,
the Hudson's Bay Company's post, now in ruins,
was in close proximity.  The site is now defined only
by a pile of stones and by several graves, with
mouldering crosses, that suggest the close of the
drama of earthly life for those who lived and toiled
here, unconsciously aiding to build up the future.
The very atmosphere is pervaded by a sense of
heroic effort.
</p>

<p>
One of the delightful excursions for sylvan
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
wanderers is that of the trail to Maligne Lake, a
beautiful sheet of water some thirty miles distant;
and in Maligne Canyon, only eight miles from
Jasper, are two comfortable shelter-houses for the
free use of all tourists; each house divided into
three parts, with one large room for ladies, one for
gentlemen, and a central hall fitted with a range and
other conveniences, where impromptu cooking may
be conducted with successful results.  These
shelter-houses provide one more illustration of the way in
which the tourist is safe-guarded all over the
Dominion, even in what would seem her most
impenetrable localities.  So swiftly are modern
conditions of comfort on their winged way that the
refinements of life fairly spring up in the wilderness
and almost every conceivable need or requirement
of the traveller is anticipated.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian summer resorts are destined to
play an important part in sociology.  They attract
sojourners from widely separated localities and
promote interchange of views, of valuable knowledge,
of ideas, of sympathies, that form an interchange
of the utmost significance in its influence
and determining effect upon the general international
life.  The summer allurements of the Dominion are
to be increasingly appreciated by the civilised world,
as they open up new realms teeming with new
inspirations.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of Banff and Lake Louise is already
known to the tourist, but it is, rather especially, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
wonderful region opened to travel by the extensions
of the Grand Trunk System that is so unusually
spellbinding.  The grandeur of these majestic
mountain-peaks; the valleys and plateaus amid the
gleam of lake and river; the brilliant foliage; the
rich scheme of colour of purple and vermilion cliffs;
the glint of blue waters through overarching
trees&mdash;Ah!  Land of the Maple Leaf, how fair is thy
heritage!

CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
COBALT AND THE SILVER MINES
</h3>

<p>
The famous Cobalt Silver Mines naturally focus the
interest of the capitalist and the financier in any
tour across the great Dominion.  While British
Columbia and the Yukon have been called the
"Wonderland" of Canada, not alone for their
mineral possibilities, but for a great wealth of other
natural resources besides, and because many millions
of dollars have been extracted by placer miners from
rivers and streams, yet Ontario is found to exceed
all other provinces, so far as yet developed, in the
volume of mineral production.  The Klondyke
gold discoveries in the Canadian Yukon became a
romance which has fairly rivalled the Tale of the
Golden Fleece.  Yet when in the year 1903 the
copious and apparently unmeasurable deposits of
silver-cobalt ores containing an extraordinarily
high percentage of silver were discovered in the
district of Cobalt (not far to the west from Lake
Temiskaming), this event sent a thrill of sensation
through the world of mining and mineral interests
that left little to exceed, in romantic ardour, in the
poetic legends of the Yukon:
</p>

<a id="img-128"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-128.jpg" alt="Cobalt, Ontario" />
<br />
Cobalt, Ontario
</p>

<p>
Since the discovery of silver in 1903, Cobalt has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
produced $130,000,000 worth of the white metal.
Dividends totalling over $60,000,000 have been
paid to shareholders of twenty-four mines.  One
company alone has distributed among its
shareholders in dividends nearly $15,000,000.
</p>

<p>
In some of the Cobalt mines the ores that
contained such phenomenal quantities of silver have
been depleted, and ores of lower grade are now being
worked, so that a much larger mass of ore, more
machinery, and a larger force of working-men are
now required to produce the same amount of
silver.
</p>

<p>
The geological intervention of radioactivity is
believed by physicists to have a determining influence
upon the development of subterranean resources
as well as upon the surface features of the earth and
the formation of mountain chains.  Vitality is another
ever-increasing phenomenon, but the bewildering
abundance of life that confronts the student of
nature is no more inciting to research than the
mystery of metals deposited far in the ground.  The
natural resources of Canada are so vast that even
yet, as Dr. W. J. A. Donald asserts, "the greater
part of three million six hundred thousand square
miles of the Dominion is still <i>terra incognita</i> as
regards its mineral resources, or even its geological
features."
</p>

<p>
During the present war all enterprises are, more
or less, and, indeed, largely, in abeyance in the
Dominion; but the present is always compact of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
future, nor can any strictly dividing line be drawn.
"Even in the midst of the greatest tragedies,"
said Sir Clifford Sifton in his address before the
Canadian Club of Montreal on January 25, 1915,
"while we are trying to do our duty in the greatest
crisis of life, we still must speak, act, think, and do
in reference to the ordinary affairs of life; and the
better we think and act and do in regard to these
affairs, the better we shall act in these crises and
the better we shall discharge our duty."  Canada will
never be numbered with those nations regarding
whom the words were said of old, "Where there is
no vision the people perish."
</p>

<p>
There is no lack of vision in the Dominion.  The
splendid loyalty of Canada, not only to the Empire,
but to the cause of righteousness, is beyond all
estimate in words; as the Right Honourable Sir
Robert L. Borden has so finely expressed, there can
be only one conclusion regarding the present tragedy
of conflict.  "To overthrow the most powerful and
highly organised system of militarism that ever
existed must necessarily entail terrible war and
perhaps a protracted struggle.  We have not glorified
war or sought to depart from the paths of peace;
but our hearts are firm and united in an inflexible
determination that the cause for which we have
drawn the sword shall be maintained to an
honourable and triumphant issue."
</p>

<p>
This is the spirit of the Dominion.  But all conflicts
must have an end, and when the end of this struggle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
comes there is a marvellous future awaiting the
Dominion.  The future of a nation as well as that
of an individual is not merely, nor even mostly,
to be mechanically surveyed.  It is not a definite
geographical region with boundaries that can be
located and crossed with a clear knowledge of the
line of demarcation.  The future is something that
is created by men's thoughts.  It is made, not found;
it is constructed, not discovered.  And thus, even
while all internal industries are somewhat in the
grasp of an enforced pause, yet new plans and
projects for the future are in order.  The mineral
resources of Canada are incalculable.  But that they
will form one of the most remarkable factors in her
future prosperity and importance is a practicable
certainty.
</p>

<p>
It was somewhere as early as 1846 that the veins of
silver were discovered in the region adjacent to Port
Arthur on Lake Superior; and twenty years later
that ore was actively producing silver which it
continued to do until 1903.  On a small island, near
Thunder Cape (known as the Silver Islet), was the
most famous and the richest of these mines, and the
ore, interlined with veins of quartz and carbonates,
was found in a wide area.  It traversed a large belt
of diabase, and only where the vein transversed the
diabase was it richly infused with silver.  Otherwise,
it bore galena alone.  As early as 1884 the mine had
carried to a level of nearly two thousand feet, and it
was estimated that not less than three million two
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of silver
had been extracted from it.
</p>

<p>
When the Cobalt silver mines began to be worked,
Canada took her place as the third silver-producing
country in the world; and this distinction must be
largely attributed to the richness and copious
output of these particular veins.
</p>

<p>
Cobalt is about 330 miles north of Toronto, on
the Ontario Government Railway, and four hours
south of Cochrane.  At Cobalt the mines are clustered
all around and beneath the town, a lake in the
centre having been drained to facilitate the search
for ore.  To the south-east these mines are
distributed over a distance of four miles.  While the
Cobalt silver district proper is comprised within
this area, other mines, and productive ones too,
have been found in the farther outlying country.
London is the chief silver market of the world.
Much of the bullion shipped from Cobalt is sent
directly there, and London is also the basing point
of prices.
</p>

<p>
The vast mills of Cobalt, transforming the crude
ore into bullion, and the hydraulic plant on the
top of a hill, where one man manipulates power
sufficient to wash down huge rocks and to uproot
and send down large trees and stumps, open out
to the uninitiate a new idea of the way in which
man contrives to control Nature and force her to
do his bidding.
</p>

<p>
At Cobalt the "silver sidewalk" is not only an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
actual and visible spectacle, a solid surface on the
level ground of shining silver from one to three feet
in extent, but it is an indication of untold possibilities.
Still, up to this time, the richness of the veins
has been found to be rather in their number than
their depth.  These deposits are found in association
with the pre-Cambrian rocks which, according to the
geologists, belong to the Huronian and the Keewatin
formations, through which a later diabase has been
intruded in the form of a sill.  This is not held to be
necessarily the source of the ore deposits, but rather
the means of opening the way for their introduction
from other sources.  A large majority of the productive
veins, some eighty per cent., in fact, occur
solely in the Huronian formation.  The remaining
twenty per cent. is divided between the Keewatin
and the later diabase.  As has been said above, these
deposits are not especially deep, most of them being
found below the sill within a depth of two hundred
feet.  The ores from all the Cobalt region include
white arsenic, cobalt oxide, and nickel oxide, as
well as the fine silver, and not infrequently a
semi-refined mixture of the cobalt and nickel oxides.
</p>

<p>
If silver were the magnet that first drew the
attention of the miner, the prospector, or the
capitalist to Cobalt, it is not the only encouragement
to the settlement of all this beautiful region.  A
few miles out from Cobalt is the pretty suburb of
New Liskeard on a sheet of the bluest water,
sparkling in the sunshine and the transparent air;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
where numbers of artistically designed cottages
have sprung up; where the business street reveals
a thriving trade; where one or two newspapers are
published; and where the seeker after the occult may
find his palmist and his mental healer as well as his
dentist and his physician.  Electric cars connect
this idyllic little village with Cobalt, and motor
cars dart about in a way which suggests that this
region is by no means outside of the cosmopolitan
luxuries of life.  The country is one of great scientific
interest.  The geologist may find new data; the
botanist and ornithologist new fields for observation.
</p>

<p>
Cobalt is recognised as a permanent silver camp,
and as one of the richest on the entire American
continent.  At first the stories told of silver paths,
brilliant and shining in the sunshine, were regarded
as part and parcel of the usual myths that spring
up in mining camps.  But the "silver sidewalks"
were there.  They were the most palpable of facts.
A hundred miles to the north of the town of Cobalt,
on Porcupine Creek, the prospectors found gold.
Specimens of the alluring yellow ore may be seen in
glass cases in the corridor of the King Edward Hotel,
Toronto.  In that city many of the miners may be
met, for mining is now a scientific pursuit rather than
merely an industry, and whether the miner takes
his ease in cosmopolitan centres and gives his mines
"absent treatment," after the convenient fashion
of Christian Scientists, or whether he is less remote
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
from his interests, does not seem to affect the results
in a vital manner.
</p>

<p>
During the year 1915 thirteen mines in Northern
Ontario produced gold, and many of these are now
making alterations and additions to their plants
which will enable them to largely increase their
output.

To find this possibly incalculable wealth in the
densely wooded wilderness is a continually increasing
surprise.  The Porcupine district, as well as the
Cobalt region, is reached by the Temiskaming and
Northern Ontario Railway, a line of two hundred
miles in length, built by the Province of Ontario,
and furnishing connection between the Transcontinental
line from Quebec to Winnipeg, north of the
lakes, and the cities in the southern portion of the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  The construction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
of this connecting line led to the discovery of Lake
Timagami (one of the popular summer resorts), and
about thirty miles north of the lake the first
indication of silver was accidently found by a workman
who hurled his hammer at a scampering rabbit
and hit a rock instead, chipping off a layer that
disclosed a vein of almost pure silver.  This initiated
the famous La Rose mine, taking its name from the
man who made this fortunate throw of his hammer,
and within the succeeding four years this immediate
region was capitalised at some five hundred millions.
While the Cobalt silver mines, then, owe their
discovery to this employee on the line, the engineers
prospecting for the grade of the Grand Trunk Pacific
accidentally uncovered vast coal-fields in Alberta.
</p>

<p>
This Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway
connects the Grand Trunk System at North Bay
with the Canadian Government lines at Cochrane.
The opening up of all this country has not only
resulted in the exploiting of these famous mines,
but has brought to knowledge the existence of the
largest tract of pulpwood in the world.  The belt
of these forests extends from Ontario to Quebec
and westward to the prairies of Manitoba, a thousand
miles of almost unbroken woodland.
</p>

<p>
The hydraulic mechanism used in prospecting
for ore is one of the marvels of inventive genius.
One man can operate the powerful lever that turns
on a torrent of water against trees, huge stumps,
vast rocks, and sends them rolling down the hillside.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
All obstruction, indeed, the very hill itself, is
washed down.  The twentieth century will always
stand out as a remarkable era for the invention of
mechanism to harness and utilise power hitherto
undreamt of for practical application.  These
inventions are securing the increasing spiritual
liberation of man.  When he is enabled to harness the
powers of the ether; to send the lightning on his
errands; to bridle a force that no man ever saw or
touched; when he can cause the waves of the ether
to serve his chariot wheels, he has indeed transformed
the world in which he finds himself.
</p>

<p>
There are rumours of a recent invention made
by Mr. Asa Thurston Heydon in the Yukon that
may largely revolutionise the mining industry.  It
was in the middle 'eighties that Mr. Heydon began
studying the primitive divining-rod, the use of
which he was inclined to believe was based upon
some germs of scientific truth.  He thought it
possible that some natural law lay hidden in the
garments of superstition.  For thirty years he
experimented and observed.  This research has led
him to what he believes is a series of discoveries,
one of which is his invention called the clairoscope,
which is the diviner for substances that are in the
earth.  Fitted with one or another substance
attached, it turns to that which corresponds with
the given thing attached.  He calls the instrument
the clairoscope and the result obtained the clairum.
The clairum, Mr. Heydon explains, is the counterpart
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
of the spectrum.  The latter is limited to the
luminous, the former to the non-luminous, rays.  The
spectrum exemplifies one pole of the spherical
organisation of energy, and the clairum exemplifies
the opposite pole.  Mr. Heydon's researches are
based on his conviction that everything, organic
and inorganic, from electrons to the mighty universe
itself, is surrounded by a sphere; that these spheres
blend and combine "in accordance with the laws
of force-centres," but that in all combinations
"they retain their identity as do rays of light."  This
interesting speculator holds that the non-luminous
rays are constant, changing only from
attraction to repulsion, and that they are the radii
of the spheres.  He believes that the distinctive
energy that operates the clairoscope is a higher
dynamic energy; nothing less, indeed, than that
vital force which is characteristic of all life.  "A
name must be found," he says, "for this vital force
which is rhythmically circulating throughout the
universe, forming the pulse of existence.  The dream
of the alchemist is founded in the nature of things,"
continues Mr. Heydon, "and will be realised when
mankind shall have discovered the simple process
of polarising and depolarising electrons at will.  This
will induce the polarisation of the correlated material
sphere, and an electron of the desired element will
awaken from its slumbers."
</p>

<p>
To what degree Mr. Heydon's theories will bear
the test of his future investigations it is impossible
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
to conjecture; but it is already true that the
clairoscope is being used to some extent to locate minerals
and has proved useful.
</p>

<p>
To descend into a mine, down to a three hundred
and fifty feet level, and see the strange panorama of
life that is before one's eyes, is a novel experience.
Into the cage steps the little party, and the
downward journey begins.  All is dark save for the lamps
of the miners, affixed to their caps, and the lights
that are swung give a fitful and weird illumination.
Through the narrow aisles on every level push-carts
are passing, and the visitor must pack himself
into as little space as possible as he stands against
the wall to let the traffic pass by.  Everything is
dripping; one walks in mud and water, and sees the
glisten of the wet walls.  The air is cold and damp.
It seems inconceivable that men can work under
such conditions, yet the visitor is assured by some
of the workmen themselves that they prefer this
labour to any of the employments open to them on
the surface of the earth.  This subterranean world
incites curiosity, interest, and still the onlooker is
not sorry when he finds himself again in the air and
sunlight above.
</p>

<p>
On the hills about Cobalt are perched attractive
cottages and bungalows, and the quiet, pleasantly
social little town bears no trace of the traditional
atmosphere of the mining-camp of that peculiar
order that has been most vividly derived from the
pictures in the novels of Bret Harte.

CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
WINNIPEG AND EDMONTON
</h3>

<p>
The traveller whose imagination had vaguely
pictured Winnipeg as a fur-trading station
somewhere toward the North Pole would be aroused
from such reveries by the spectacle of this brilliant
and cosmopolitan centre, with its beautiful architecture,
its broad boulevards, the magnificent Fort
Garry Hotel on the site of the ancient fort, and the
civic centre in the Free Exposition building, where
specimens of all the great products of the Canadian
West are displayed.  Winnipeg, which in 1870 had
a population of two hundred and fifteen people, in
1917 records its quarter of a million.  It grows at
such a rate that it is unsafe to prophesy to what
degree these figures may be increased in the
immediate future.  A representative of Baedeker, who
had been sent to the United States to prepare a
volume on its western regions, complained to a
fellow-voyager on the ocean steamer, when returning to his
own country, that it was mathematically impossible
to cope with the Far West with any accuracy.  "Why,
I prepare the exact population of a town&mdash;Seattle,
for instance&mdash;and before I can get my report into
print the population has doubled."  This was
naturally a tangible grievance, and one which was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
extremely difficult for the statistician to meet.
Possibly the same baffling problem of accuracy
confronts him who would record the population of
Winnipeg.
</p>

<p>
From the tower of the Fort Garry Hotel there is
revealed a scene hardly to be compared with any
other on the continent.  The spectator can see
broad boulevards, many of which are a hundred
and thirty-two feet in width; an electric railway,
operating hundreds of cars, whose service is said to
be the most perfect of that of any city in the States
or in Canada; streets paved with asphalt and
macadam; extensive parks, where equipages not
less fine than those of Hyde Park or the Bois de
Boulogne, are seen rolling along the smooth, winding
roads; churches, numbering nearly two hundred;
the University of Manitoba; the art school; and
the unexcelled beauty of miles of residential regions,
laid out in those graceful curves and crescents so
familiar in the West End of London&mdash;all these are
indicated in this great centre of commercial,
industrial, and social life.
</p>

<p>
To those who had thought of Winnipeg as being
remote, if not inaccessible, it is rather surprising to
find that this metropolis of Western Canada is but
twenty-seven hours from Chicago and but forty-five
hours from Washington.  At the time of the
Chicago Exposition of 1893, one of the most popular
routes between Boston and that city was through
the Hoosac tunnel, on which the passenger boarded
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
his train in Boston at seven P.M., and arrived in
Chicago at seven the second morning after&mdash;a
journey of thirty-six hours, which no one at that
time regarded as being too long.  Nor does it require
the memory of that traditional being, the "oldest
inhabitant," to recall that when the Pennsylvania
Railroad succeeded in reducing the time between
New York and Chicago to twenty-five hours, it was
then held to be much more of a marvel than is
now the eighteen-hours' journey of the Twentieth-Century
Flyer.  Winnipeg is forty-eight hours from
Montreal, fifty-three from Quebec, and only
forty-five from New York.  No city on the western
continent is more splendidly equipped than Winnipeg
for business enterprises, great conventions, and large
convocations of all orders.  Besides the spacious and
superb Fort Garry Hotel, she has more than fifty
other guest-houses and one of the largest
departmental stores on the continent; she has parks
covering more than five hundred acres; she has
more than twenty banks; and in a single year these
banks did a business of almost one billion seven
hundred million dollars.  All the grain business of
the Canadian West centres in Winnipeg.  In the
magnificent Union Station of white marble, costing
some two millions of dollars, there are twenty-seven
railway tracks, long distance and local, all of which
radiate from the city.  The Winnipeg River offers
unmeasured facilities for power, a total of sixty
thousand horse-power being already developed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
which is sold to manufacturers and other consumers
at the cost of production.  There are over four
hundred successful factory plants in operation,
employing twenty thousand factory workers.  Thus
told in bald statistics alone, the story of Winnipeg
is singularly impressive; but these facts and figures
are but the mere skeleton of the story of Winnipeg.
In this northern metropolis the polarity of life in
general is changed.

Union Station and Fort Garry Hotel, Winnipeg
</p>

<p>
A signal aim in this city is the culture of beauty.
In the laying out of streets and avenues the question
of vista and the composition, so to speak, of the
landscape has received unfailing consideration.  All
the country about is finely wooded, and with its
rolling declivities offers cool and shaded nooks and
spaces for summer outings.  Here and there are lofty
elms, and occasional wooded areas of many acres in
extent.  These are a surprise to the traveller whose
conceptions of this region have been those of a bare
and more or less desolate prairie land.  The nature
of the soil of the neighbourhood is a factor of
determining importance.  The clay belt begins at
Cochrane, the junction of the Transcontinental line with
the Ontario Government Railway, and it extends for
three hundred miles to the west, affording a tract
with plentiful water and with every productive
condition.  The provision of population for this
clay belt is now a foremost question in Canada and
engages the attention of both the Province of
Ontario and of the Transcontinental Railway.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
generation that cleared the bush lands has almost
passed away, and the present settlers have different
ideas of pioneer life.  One age does not repeat itself.
The continual invention of machinery that liberates
human life has its dominating influence, and all
signs of the times point to new methods of entering
on new settlements.  The British settlers who arrive
are not accustomed to the clearing of timber-lands,
yet this clay belt has probably resources to sustain
a population of from one to two million people, and
the climate is no more severe than that of Quebec or
of northern Maine.  The transformation of this region
of wilderness into a well-populated country would
provide a much-needed link between Eastern and
Western Canada.  The distances, as we have seen,
between Winnipeg and other of the great centres
both in the Dominion and in the United States are
by no means appalling; and with the splendid
railway facilities now provided by the new
Trans-continental route between Winnipeg, Toronto, and
Montreal, by way of Cochrane, Cobalt, and North
Bay, across New Ontario, and through the
Highlands of the same Province, a route that only
opened on July 13, 1915, this region is abounding
in attractions for the new settler.
</p>

<p>
There are two sources of revenue which are of
unmeasured value; one is that of pulpwood which
can be advantageously disposed of, and the other
that of employment in constructing government
roads.  Another inducement will be that of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
"ready-made farm."  This scheme has been utilised
to some extent in Alberta and in New Brunswick as
an inducement to colonists.  Thousands of these
farms, on which buildings have been erected and a
small area placed under cultivation, with stock and
farming implements furnished, have been placed at
the disposal of settlers, each for a small cash
payment, and with the conditions of subsequent
payments made most liberal and lenient.  In Ontario
the scheme has not yet been worked out in detail;
but the government of the Province is favourable
toward adopting a similar system, building a house
and barn and clearing ten acres on a farm of a
hundred and sixty acres, as well as advancing a
limited sum of money for the purchase of stock.
The Ontario government also propose arrangements
for assisting the farmer in marketing his pulpwood.
</p>

<p>
All these conditions of the surrounding country
are of vital importance to the city of Winnipeg.
The settlement of wild lands, the development of
industrial resources, centres of population springing
up in new sections&mdash;all these directly contribute to
the growth and importance of the metropolitan
centre.  The civilisation of Canada has proceeded
more rapidly in the transformation of the wilderness
into populated lands than did that of the western
part of the United States.  Four years after the
formation of the Dominion (July 1, 1867) Canada
had extended across the entire continent.  By the
conditions of the time, both in applied inventions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
and in the degree of progress achieved by man,
Canada has escaped the disadvantage that the long
efforts of pioneer life entail upon a nation.  The new
towns and cities begin with well-paved streets,
electric lighting, and electric transit.
</p>

<p>
Winnipeg, since 1899, has owned and operated its
own water system, which is the hydro-electric power
plant.  The architecture is largely of a permanent
nature, the designs following the latest developments
of taste, skill, and efficient construction.
Much of it compares favourably with the best
architecture of New York or Washington.  The
blocks of handsome residences; the architectural
taste of the public buildings; and the constant
series of lawns, with their flowers and plants, leafy
shrubs and luxuriant trees, make the city one of
exceeding beauty and attractiveness.  Churches,
schools (and they are among the best in Canada),
theatres, and lecture halls abound; the libraries
are particularly enlightened and helpful and their
growth and extension are only comparable with the
library developments of St. Paul and Minneapolis,
of Los Angeles and other young cities of the most
advanced degrees of progress.  "The world of books
is still the world," wrote Mrs. Browning; and the
community that renews its resources from the best
that has been thought and said in the world, as it is
conserved in literature, will be that which is the
more efficient in all that makes for human advancement.
Familiarity with the best literature has the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
most potent of influences for good taste, good
manners, high ideals of conduct, mutual courtesy,
and self-respect.
</p>

<p>
Canada cannot afford to ignore Matthew Arnold's
wise warning not to mistake material achievement
for civilisation.  In its true and full significance,
civilisation means "the humanisation of man in
society; his making progress there towards his
true and full humanity.  We hear a nation called
highly civilised," Mr. Arnold proceeds to say,
"by reason of its industry, commerce, and wealth,
or by reason of its liberty or equality, or by
reason of its numerous churches, schools, libraries,
and newspapers.  But there is something in
human nature, some instinct of growth, some law
of perfection, which rebels against this narrow
account of the matter.  Do not tell me, says human
nature, of the magnitude of your industry and
commerce; of the beneficence of your institutions,
your freedom, your equality; of the great and
growing number of your churches and schools,
libraries and newspapers; tell me also if your
civilisation&mdash;which is the grand name you give to
all this development&mdash;tell me if your civilisation is
interesting."
</p>

<p>
Carlyle, as Matthew Arnold reminds us, once
wrote to a younger brother who thought of emigrating
to the United States: "Could you banish yourself
from all that is interesting to your mind, forget
the history, the glorious institutions, the noble
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
principles of old Scotland&mdash;that you might eat a
better dinner, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Arnold hastens to disclaim any sympathy
with the idea that young men should not emigrate;
it was the term "interesting" that caught his eye
in Carlyle's counsel, and it is for that element that
he makes his eloquent plea.  It is that element,
moreover, which the young and splendid city of
Winnipeg may well reckon as one of its fundamental
characteristics.  In the <i>Journal Intime</i> of M. Amiel,
the reader finds him saying that "the human heart
is, as it were, haunted by confused reminiscences of
an age of gold; or, rather, by aspirations toward a
harmony of things which every-day reality denies to
us."  In all the appointments of wealth and luxury,
M. Amiel made an effort to realise or to approach
this ideal, and thus finds in this order of life one
form of poetry.  Society demands distinction and
beauty as a component part of human nature's daily
food.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, a new country cannot offer archives of
long centuries of history, nor ruined castles, nor an
assortment of myth and tradition.  These may and
do have their part in that atmosphere of interest
which is the nurture of the intellectual powers; but
the Future is no less stimulating than the Past;
prophecy is not less alluring than history.  The art
of life itself is the finest of all the fine arts and to the
seeing eye may invest a city with as much fascination
as is to be derived from the galleries of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
Louvre or of the Vatican.  The spiritual life of all the
ages is preserved in libraries, and the youngest of
cities may well be heir to the records of this life.
"No matter how poor I am," said William Ellery
Channing; "no matter though the prosperous of
my own time will not enter my obscure dwelling&mdash;if
the sacred virtues will enter and take up their
abode under my roof; if Milton will sing of Paradise;
and Shakespeare open to me the worlds of imagination
and the workings of the human heart; if Franklin
will enrich me with his practical wisdom&mdash;I shall
not pine for intellectual companionship, and I may
become a cultivated man, though excluded from
what is called the best society in the place where I
live."
</p>

<p>
It is not only noble art and beautiful architecture
combined with historic and social traditions that
appeal to all that is best in life.  What could more
readily appeal to the imagination than that visible
expression of faith in the future of the Great
Dominion, the completion of a new great transcontinental
line making possible direct transit across
Canada from ocean to ocean?  What could more
appeal to the imagination than the marvellous
invention of the wireless control of moving trains as
has been already described in a previous chapter?
</p>

<p>
What can, indeed, be a feature of greater interest
than the practical creation of a new world; the
power of man conquering and transforming the
domain of Nature?  Do not Romance and Poetry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
spring up here anew?  Science and the Muses have a
subtle basis of understanding.  James Russell Lowell
has interpreted this mutual comprehension in the
lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He who first stretched his nerves of subtle wire<br />
  Over the land and through the sea-depths still,<br />
  Thought only of the flame-winged messenger<br />
  As a dull drudge that should encircle earth<br />
  With sordid messages of Trade, and tame<br />
  Blithe Ariel to a bagman.  But the Muse<br />
  Not long will be defrauded.  From her foe<br />
  Her misused wand she snatches; at a touch<br />
  The Age of Wonder is renewed again,<br />
  And to our disenchanted deity restores<br />
  The Shoes of Swiftness that gave odds to Thought;<br />
  The Cloak that makes invisible; and with these<br />
  I glide an airy fire from shore to shore."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Winnipeg has an interesting centre in the
Industrial Bureau and permanent Exposition and
Public Service Building, located in the leading
business street and contributing in many ways to
the swiftest means of unfolding industrial
opportunities and to the most liberal development of the
city.  Both the Dominion and the Province of
Manitoba, beside all the railways centering in
Winnipeg and thirty western Boards of Trade, have
installed attractive and extensive exhibits of the
natural resources, so extensive, indeed, as to be
practically complete in their revelation to the visitor
of every variety and quality of the country.  The
manufacturing interests of the city are represented
by eighty-five practical exhibits of articles "made
in Winnipeg."  There is also a museum with a large
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
collection of mounted birds and wild animals of
Canada; and there are historic relics and curios;
as well as collections of economic minerals and other
exhibits of various interest.  Winnipeg has also, in
this building, the first Civic Art Gallery in Canada,
and it is wisely made free to all.  In connection with
the Gallery is an Art School where painting and
drawing are taught.  In this Public Service centre is
a Convention Hall that will seat four thousand
people and a smaller lecture or banquet hall seating
about four hundred.  There are also other
accommodations for meetings, large or small gatherings,
as may be, that are so numerous in business, social,
industrial, or educational activities.  Over seven
hundred meetings were held in this building within
the first ten months after it was opened.  Adjoining
Convention Hall is the Central Farmers' Market,
where citizens conveniently find the produce of farm,
market, or garden.  The Industrial Bureau, which
has its quarters in this building, is a thoroughly
representative one, incorporated under Provincial
Government Charter, with a directorate elected
from appointed representatives of twenty-nine
public bodies of the city, grouping together the best
talent, administrative, professional, educational, and
industrial, which could be brought together for the
work of public service.  The Bureau organisation
is non-partisan, non-sectarian, and has no axe to
grind other than that which concerns the benefit of
the whole community.  It is the Civic Bureau of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
Information for citizens, visitors, and outside
inquirers.
</p>

<p>
The Fort Garry Hotel is a social centre of Winnipeg.
Its imposing architectural effects render it a
landmark in the panoramic view of the city.  Its
walls, of buff sandstone, rise to a height of fourteen
stories, and the copper roof and lofty pinnacles are
transformed to molten gold when the sun shines on
them.  The majestic structure is an adaptation from
the period of François I., with something reminiscent
of the old chateau in Touraine and Normandy.  In
the standards of elegance and beauty in all
entertainments, these Grand Trunk hostelries&mdash;the
Château Laurier, the Fort Garry, the Macdonald
of Edmonton&mdash;all introduce standards of polite life
that are of incalculable benefit to the community
and which have hardly before been approached in
the Dominion.  In elegance and refinement, both of
appointments and of service, these hotels rival, if
indeed they do not almost excel, the choicest
luxuriance and beauty of Paris and New York.  One block
to the east of the Fort Garry is the magnificent
Union Station in which the Canadian Northern and
Grand Trunk Pacific centre, and which has every
convenience and device up to date; and between the
station and the Fort Garry Hotel is a wide boulevard
with a double row of trees in the centre, and a little
park, under the very shadow of the house, has its
picturesque approach through the ivy-clad ruins of
the old gateway to the fort; an historic reminder
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
of the time when, a century ago, this entrance was
built by the Hudson's Bay Company in a turbulent
period.  The contrast between the sense of peaceful
though intense activity, under the brilliant sunshine
over the broad, beautiful streets, whose smooth
pavement is a joy to motorists, with that time when
savage assaults must be defended by the forces
within Fort Garry, is a contrast to incite a train
of speculative reflection.  There were "sceptred
spirits" in those days whose heroic deeds shine
through all the years between their time and our
own.  The history of the Hudson's Bay Company
is, in itself, one of the most thrilling chronicles of
the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
From the windows and balconies of the Fort Garry
Hotel the view is magnificent&mdash;St. Boniface, with
its splendid cathedral group, Assiniboine Park, and
the Legislative Buildings, with two rivers winding
away into the vast spaces of the prairie&mdash;all make
up a panorama never to be forgotten.  The interior
of this alluring house is singularly charming to the
eye.  The furnishings are rich and yet have that air
of simplicity that appeals to the artistic sense&mdash;grey
marble floors with soft rugs and the main dining-room
all in cream and gold.  The foyer and loggia
connecting the banquet and ball rooms suggest the
ancient cloister with their vaulted ceilings and the
mediæval lanterns for electric lights.  The café has
marble wainscoting, suggestive of some old baronial
castle, while in the grillroom there is oak panelling
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
that would delight old England.  There are three
hundred rooms, two hundred and thirty-five of
which have private baths while the others have
easy access to bathrooms.  What a contrast of living
is thus revealed between the fastidious and luxurious
life of the twentieth century and that of the primitive
days of a hundred years ago when the old Fort Garry
occupied the site of this hotel!
</p>

<p>
For fully fifty miles west of Winnipeg extends
a belt of land some 300 miles in width, provided with
good water found at reasonable depths, which is
the marvel of the world for grain raising.  This Red
River Valley is the great wheat-producing region
of the continent, and the journey of nearly eight
hundred miles from Winnipeg to Edmonton reveals
vast fields of golden grain, while along the route the
colossal elevators loom up in the level expanse like
some colossal fortifications.
</p>

<p>
Winnipeg has been from the first a predestined
centre of commerce.  It is the metropolis of the
transcontinental lines and is the one supreme gateway
through which all travellers and all traffic from
ocean to ocean must pass.  No other city on the
western continent has such an absolute monopoly of
all transit from the east to the west, or the reverse.
</p>

<p>
Edmonton, the capital of Alberta, most attractive
in its beauty of locality, stands on the bold bluffs of
the Saskatchewan.  The railway bridge spanning this
gulf is one of the finest on the continent, with its
imposing piers of hewn stone, over a hundred feet in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
height, with trusses of steel.  Two bridges at the
level of the river provide for other traffic, with the
novel arrangement that heavy vehicles are lifted and
lowered from the surface of the bluff to the river
by means of colossal elevators.  The elevator is a
municipal institution, and municipal ownership is
the general rule in Edmonton, the city owning and
operating the trolley lines, the electric light plant,
the water-works, and the telephone system.  Edmonton
would be the earthly paradise of the disciples of
Henry George, for it is a single-tax town.  The
University of Alberta with its splendid campus of
three hundred and fifty acres, fronts the impressive
capitol, of cream-hued sandstone, which stands on
the Edmonton side of the river.
</p>

<p>
The capitol is four stories in height, with classic
portico and a dome surmounted by a tall lantern,
while the building is rendered still more beautiful
by its artistic approach; wide terraced steps, with
balustrades, ornamented with heavy bronze lamps,
the effect of which, when lighted at night, is not
without reminiscences of Paris.  The Hotel
Macdonald has a charming situation on the high bank
of the river, within a few minutes' walk of the centre
of the town.  The traveller enters by the spacious
court and covered loggia, passing thence into the
great rotunda, with its floor of pink Levantine
marble and its ceiling of solid oak.  Adjoining this is
a lounge, opening on a terrace 50 feet wide, overlooking
the river, and the palm-room (octagonal in form,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
with its dome decorated in Wedgwood designs), as
well as a beautiful dining-room, a café, and other
public rooms.  As one walks through all this
magnificence in the place so recently occupied by Indians,
hunters, and trappers of the frontier trading posts,
he begins to realise something of that almost
incredible rapidity of growth and development that
characterises the great North-West.
</p>

<p>
The Canadian Women's Press Club in Edmonton
is an organisation that delights the heart of the
modern woman, to whom her clubs are the very
breath of being; and its President, Mrs. Arthur
Murphy, is well known to the world of letters under
her <i>nom de plume</i>, "Janey Canuck."  Mrs. Murphy
is one of the most famous of Canadian writers, and
has contributed much to the general knowledge of
the Dominion.  Her work has received very high
praise.  "She has opened a new path in Canadian
literature," says an eminent critic, "and her <i>Open
Trails</i> and <i>Seeds of Pine</i> will inspire many other
writers."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Murphy is the wife of the Rev. Arthur
Murphy, D.D., who at one time was the chaplain to
the Empress Frederick.  Her work has attracted
much attention in England, and <i>The Bookman</i> of
London, in a critical review of her books extending
into several pages, said:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The work of 'Janey Canuck' has the optimism of the
true lyric; the song of the open road.  The refrain of the
windswept spaces was never set to a better tune....  It
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
is not style that matters in the work of 'Janey Canuck'
any more than it matters in the work of Walt Whitman&mdash;a
kindred philosopher.  She comes scattering seeds of
gladness in our mist, and lo! our gloom is gone like a black
cloud that breaks before the April sun.  She is the
philosopher of gladness and content and common sense, a
philosophy as durable as Bergsonism."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mrs. Murphy has been honoured by King George
by the decoration that entitles her to be known as
a "Lady of Grace," an appropriate title, indeed,
for so gracious a lady.
</p>

<p>
Edmonton is the gateway to the Yellowhead Pass;
and the beauty of its location, the charming nature
of its people, and the vastness of the territory of
which it is naturally the centre, all conspire to
incite dream and prophecy of the future of this young
city of University ideals and marked intellectual
and literary quality.

CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
ON THE GRAND TRUNK PACIFIC
</h3>

<p>
One of the most enchanting pleasure trips that can
be enjoyed on the North American continent is that
from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert through regions
of scenic glory
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Where all wonder tales come true";<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
where one journeys to the accompaniment of a
bewildering series of surprises that open vistas of
new interests and enjoyments never dreamed of
before.  It is one of the signal charms of a journey
through regions of majestic beauty and of scenic
enchantment that it is not over even when it is
past.  Such a trip is a treasure laid up in life for
future enjoyment without limit.
</p>

<p>
It is only some five hours from Edmonton before
one begins to enter on this wonderland of romance.
It is so new that the world of travel has not yet
realised the marvel and glory of this trip.  When
it is stated that even the first surveying for this
transcontinental line began only in 1910, it will
be readily seen that in this region is opened up an
absolutely new part of the world to general travel.
The anomaly of traversing these primeval wilds in
a train so luxuriously appointed as are the limiteds
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
on the Grand Trunk Pacific appeals to the
comprehension of man's conquest over nature.  To travel
in the comfort of these commodious coaches,
equipped with a richly-furnished drawing-room, an
admirable dining-car, an observation car with a
spacious balcony platform at the rear and fitted
with writing-desks, stationery in abundance, books,
magazines, and newspapers, is to enjoy a journey
on a flying hotel.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a train worth while!" wrote Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle after the conclusion of the extensive
trip that he and Lady Conan Doyle enjoyed over
the Dominion: "it is the latest word in comfort, in
luxury, in safety, in speed.  The dining-car is never
taken off.  The observation car is a pleasant club.
The road is as smooth as polished marble, with
heavy rails well ballasted, no smoke or cinders....
It has the highest maintenance of track and rolling
stock....  It runs on a marvellous line, destined
to a mighty future."

<p>
The entrance to the Wonderland begins, as was
said, some five hours from Edmonton.  The best plan
is to leave this thriving young capital of Alberta by
a late evening train, and waken in the morning to
find one's self in a region where the peaks to the
south of the Yellowhead Pass begin to appear on the
horizon.  He who understands the romance of railroad
travel will raise the heavy blind of the windows
of his lower berth or his drawing-room, so as not to
miss the strange panorama of the night.  Indeed, if
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
we compare the romance of a night on shipboard
with that of a night on a flying railroad train, the
latter is incomparably the greater.  The first requisite
is an added relay of pillows&mdash;all that one wants,
and all that one does not want, so to speak&mdash;pillows
on which to prop one's self up to the proper angle of
altitude that he may lie at ease and watch that
marvellous moving panorama of forest and glade,
of starlit sky, or of the hills flooded with moonlight;
with flitting gleams of shining silver as the train
glides past lakes, or along the course of a winding
river.  It is the realm of fäery, where nothing is but
what is not.  Is there a moon?  There are a dozen
moons!  There is one in the south, but a moment
later it appears in the far east&mdash;no well-regulated
moon would career about in the heavens in so erratic
a manner, therefore there must be another; and
when, at the next glimpse, it again appears at some
different point of the compass, one's conviction that
the earth must have as many moons as Jupiter is
reinforced.  The vast forest solitudes are all strange;
to waken suddenly and find one's self flying through
these unreal regions is an experience never to be
forgotten.  It is an experience entirely lost save to
one who unveils his windows to the mystic scenes
rather than sleep in the darkness of drawn blinds.
The elusive fascination possible to the nights on a
railway train is a chapter of life in itself.  It recalls
to one the dictum of Socrates that all exact inquiry
into such matters as the movements and nature of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
the sun and the moon should be excluded from too
close investigation!
</p>

<p>
From Winnipeg the traveller speeds over fields
of emerald or fields of gold, according to the season;
the harvest time is a world of gold and resplendence;
and ere the grain ripens it forms an infinite expanse
of tender green.  The economist would see in these
far-reaching fields of growing grain a theme for his
statistics and practical deductions as to their
contribution to the world's wealth; but the eye of the
pleasure-traveller regards them solely in the light of
æsthetic effect.  Wheat or oats, grass or anything
else, it is all one to him as long as the colour scheme
enchants his eye.  As he approaches the mountain
region the scene is etherealised.  Away on the
horizon are illuminated points, but whether on earth,
or in the heavens, who can tell?  One begins to
enter into the atmosphere that pervades mountain
solitudes.  It eludes all analysis, but it is the most
potent of impressions.  The gateway to the mountains
prefigures itself as the portal to some trackless
spaces not of earth.  The peaks shine with a celestial
light.  Snow-capped, catching the morning sunshine
in dazzling splendour, they rise as a very wall beyond
which mortal may not pass.  Is the wall as impenetrable
as it seems?  How can a railway train dash
itself through the palisades of bewildering mountain
peaks, clustered in their shining splendour?  And
what world lies beyond?
</p>

<p>
The grandeur grows more impressive.  And as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
among the problems of life, so among mountains,
there is usually a way out.  In this case it is the
Yellowhead Pass.  In the preliminary survey and
construction of the railroad this Pass was chosen
by the skilled engineers who at once recognised its
striking characteristics, for it permitted the railway
to take its line across the Rocky Mountains at the
lowest altitude of any transcontinental line on the
continent.  The swiftly flowing waters of the
Athabasca River mirror the towering peaks above.  The
Pass grows wider; again, there is a narrower curve
as it deftly penetrates its way between the vast
heights.  The tourist has of course betaken himself
to the outside platform of the observation car.  Here
is a spacious balcony, with projecting roof to shield
from sun or wind; a space ample for some sixteen
seats, which offers a moving picture that reveals the
handiwork of Nature as distinct from that of Art.
Here the traveller sits, with all the majesty of the
mountain contours about and above him.
</p>

<p>
This Yellowhead Pass had been, for some generations,
the great natural highway of the fur trade.
The Hudson Bay post was established here as early
as in 1800, and the name of a yellow-haired trader,
known to the Indians as "Tête Jaunne" (otherwise
Jasper Hawes), led to the present name of this
historic spot.  One cannot but dwell a little on the
Yellowhead Pass itself, as one of the special features
of the trip; not merely a passage-way to traverse,
but as a region rich in novel points of beauty, never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
twice the same, but varying with every atmospheric
change and from every new angle of vision.  Traverse
the Yellowhead Pass by day in the brilliant sunlight;
or on one of the marvellous moonlit nights, when
every peak rises in silver sheens; when the stars
look down as if they were great globes of light near
at hand, and the walls of sheer rock are so softened
under the mystic light as to be no more mere rocky
precipices, but the field of the weird dances of the
Brocken.  Gnomes and sprites emerge from some
unseen caverns; the cliffs tower into the sky and
bring the stars down to earth, so as to make them
seem as accessible as electric lights.  There are
projecting balconies far above where perhaps the
Spirits of the Solitudes congregate.
</p>

<p>
The eastern approach to the Yellowhead Pass is
guarded by the Boule Roche and the Roche à
Perdrix Mountains, these marking, also, the entrance
to Jasper Park.  The fabled Valley of the Cashmere
is hardly less familiar to the great tide of summer
travel than is this Yellowhead region.  In a preceding
chapter (on the summer resorts of Canada) the
pleasure resources of Jasper Park were somewhat
suggested, and Mount Robson Park will doubtless
also become one of the great favourites of the world.
The great natural reserve of Jasper Park comprising
4400 square miles is one that for all time will be
preserved in its absolute integrity.  No spoliation
will be permitted.  It is not only a national but a
continental pleasure-ground for all time.  Mountain-climbers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
will find here the fullest scope for their
prowess.  More and more will the Mountaineering
enthusiasts of Britain be allured to Canada instead
of to Switzerland&mdash;a part of the great Empire,
calling with a thousand voices to every trueborn
Briton.  To many visitors the best use they have for
a mountain peak is to look at it rather than to
ascend it.  Why tramp about when the eye registers
all its supreme splendour and the tourist may
luxuriate in the shaded portico outside his camp
and revel in the changeful panorama of colour and
beauty?  Or he may stroll in fertile valleys, brilliant
with flowers; he may ride, or drive, along good trails
with new enchantments meeting him at every turn.
</p>

<p>
Two beautiful lakes, Pyramid and Patricia, are
in the very shadow of Pyramid Mountain, only four
miles from Jasper station.  At this station are the
Park superintendent and his staff, who are ever
ready with help and information and who effectually
banish from the mind of the tourist any fear
of strangeness or solitude.  While hunting is not
permitted in Jasper Park, the angler may, if he likes,
fish all day in the clear lakes.  They are well stocked
with trout.  The complete ban upon hunting or any
use of firearms is a great safeguard to the wanderer
through woods and valleys, making accidents of
this nature impossible.  Maligne Cañon and Maligne
Lake have been already discussed in the chapter
already alluded to on summer resorts, but no
description could convey any idea of the spectacular
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
beauty of the excursion leading past Lakes Edith
and Beauvert, through dense forests of spruce
and cottonwood, with the walls of the cañon rising
300 feet in height on either side.  Here is a trip of
thirty-five miles from the cañon to Maligne Lake,
that sheet of pure, emerald water&mdash;an excursion
amid such magnificence of beauty as to defy
adequate description.
</p>

<p>
Jasper Park is now enriched by the presence of
an imperishable monument that will endure throughout
the ages; one to which thousands of travellers,
in the years to come, will make their pilgrimage as
to a shrine.  It is a memorial that not only lends its
glory to the Dominion, but to the entire continent
as well; for not unaccompanied by faithful hearts
from her great sister nation across the border shall
Canadians seek this mystic altar to which every
wind wafts aromatic fire.  For it is a shrine consecrate
to all that is noblest in womanhood, all that is most
heroic and divine in our common humanity.  The
Dominion, the States, are at one in their reverent
appreciation of the greatness of simple fidelity to
duty.  He who keeps faith with his ideals is the true
hero.  It is he who enters into the fellowship of the
mystery.  He may go down to death in apparent
darkness and defeat; he rises in eternal glory.  For
to be spiritually-minded is life and peace, even the
life eternal.
</p>

<p>
It is fitting that Edith Cavell, who gave her life
for her country; who died the death of the martyr
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
rather than betray her trust, should be commemorated
with a memorial whose monumental grandeur
exceeds that of any Egyptian king or Assyrian
monarch of remote antiquity.
</p>

<p>
A marvel of glory is this mountain peak now
christened Mount Edith Cavell.  It rises in solitary
majesty out of this morning-world, lifting its head
into the faint, transparent azure of ethereal spaces,
while its base is rooted amid the rocky fastnesses
of the great range.  The naming of Mount Edith
Cavell is the tribute of the Dominion to one
great-souled woman, and thus to all that makes for the
greatness of womanhood.  On its precipitous slopes
may be read by all who have the inner vision the
scroll of human fate.
</p>

<p>
The peak is calculated to enchain the eye by
its towering height and faultless symmetry.  Did
Nature herself design and fashion it for its strange
destiny?  Was it indeed reserved for its present
consecration?  Who may know?  Life is a chain of
sequences divinely ordered.  It lieth not with man
to direct his steps.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The shuttle of the Unseen powers<br />
  Works out a pattern not as ours."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the matter of naming new places in Canada
the Geographic Board is the governing body.  It
was at their meeting in Ottawa in March 1916
that the decision was made that this peak should
immortalise the name of Edith Cavell.  The
suggestion had previously been made that the name of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
Mount Robson should be changed to that of Mount
Cavell, but this would have been so inevitably
confusing all over the world that it was thought
wiser to select a peak hitherto unnamed.  To
Dr. E. Deville, the Surveyor-General, the Geographic
Board therefore made this announcement much to
the gratification of that well-known official.  Thus
is a woman's life of simple faithfulness to duty
lifted into immortal resplendence.  What a monitor
suggesting unfaltering devotion to great issues will
Mount Edith Cavell remain to the throngs of
passengers on this Grand Trunk Pacific line, who will
watch for its appearance on the horizon, and gaze,
with steadfast view, until it fades in the far distance.
For several miles can it be seen, and what traveller
will gaze on this height without feeling it to be one
of the spellbinders of the Dominion? or without
finding himself involuntarily recalling those wonderful
lines of Emerson?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Inspirer, prophet evermore!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pillar which God aloft hath set<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that men might it not forget;<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Brulè Lake, in Jasper Park, is an expansion of
the Athabasca River, and the railroad line follows
the east bank of the lake.  Canada would be the
paradise of Undine, the water sprite of La Motte
Fouqué's famous story, for rivers broaden into
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
lakes, and lakes connect themselves by a chain of
rivers, until the continuous possibilities for inland
navigation appeal to the geologist as a problem of
the ages to be solved.  Many theories are evolved;
even as they are in Arizona, as to the origin of
that apparently impenetrable mystery, the petrified
forest.
</p>

<p>
At the station of Miette Hot Springs another
excursion may beckon to some travellers in that
up the valley of Fiddle Creek, which flows into the
Athabasca River.  There are a number of basins
encrusted with yellow from the sulphur that abounds
in the water, which has strong medicinal properties,
and which ranges from a hundred and eleven to a
hundred and twenty-seven degrees in temperature.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, there are the Punch Bowl Falls,
reached by an attractive trail from the station
known as Pocahontas.  Jasper Park extends to the
boundary line which marks the division between
Alberta and British Columbia; and crossing this
boundary the traveller finds himself in another of
Canada's gigantic reserves, that of Mount Robson
Park, with Mount Robson itself as the centre
dominating the entire region.  The train stops at
Mount Robson station, and one seems to enter a
new world in this near approach to that king and
monarch of the Canadian Rockies, the peak of
Mount Robson towering upwards for 13,068 feet in
the clear air.  Of his first view of this peak Lawrence
J. Burpee, F.R.G.S., writes:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"... Almost without warning it came.  We rounded
the western end of the Rainbow Mountains and looked up
the valley of the Grand Fork.  'My God!' some one
whispered.  Rising at the head of the valley and towering
far above all the surrounding peaks we saw a vast cone,
so perfectly proportioned that one's first impression was
rather one of wonderful symmetry and beauty than of
actual height.  Then we began to realise the stupendous
majesty of the mountain...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is not only that Mount Robson is supreme in
the range of the Rockies in Canada, but it is one of
the notable mountains of the world.  In its peculiar
beauty of form and proportion it is hardly surpassed
by any known peak.  It has many aspects and
phases&mdash;it is clearly seen in brilliant sunshine, it is
dimly discerned when it enwraps itself in clouds
and ethereal mists, it is seen again by resplendent
moonlight&mdash;and one finds each phase has its own
enchantment.  Its glistening crest is visible for
twelve miles after the train pulls out from the
station.  Its colossal glacier tumbles masses of
ice-fields down into Berg Lake at the foot, and these
masses of ice continue to drift on the surface of
emerald water that holds its colour in the same
strange way as do the waters of the Gulf of Corinth.
</p>

<p>
The Alpine Club of Canada has made excursions
to these places, and of one quest on Berg Lake a
member writes:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"... I shall not soon forget that first day when we
came up the trail and, looking through as far as the eye
could reach, saw countless blossoms&mdash;brilliant crimson
Indian paintbrush, pale pink columbines, and mauve
asters, their stems imbedded in the softest and greenest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
of foliage and moss; nor another day, when on the side of
Rearguard, we came upon a garden of blue forget-me-nots....
Whilst we lingered amongst the flowers that first day,
an avalanche crashed into the lake and the big waves came
rolling across until they reached the shore above which we
were standing, while broken ice floated out as miniature
icebergs upon the milky blue surface of the lake.  And Lake
Adolphus, across the Pass&mdash;I could not find a word to
describe its indescribable blue.  Seen from camp or through
the trees from the side of Mount Mumm, it was absolutely
lovely.  Then there was the Robson Glacier, in plain view
of camp and only a few minutes' walk distant, a never-ending
source of interest, with its ice cave and its seracs
and crevasses."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the train sweeps on the tourist sees, from his
comfortable seat on the platform of the observation
car, a myriad rocky pinnacles silhouetted
against the heavens.  The peerless grandeur of these
peaks, snow-crowned and glistening with glaciers;
of emerald lakes at the foot mirroring overhanging
crags; of unmeasured wastes of windswept snow-fields;
of ethereal solitudes and depths unfathomed,
in the wild gorges, where, for all the eternities, only
the stars have looked down; and the isolated
grandeur of Mount Robson itself lifting its glittering
summit into the skies&mdash;all this amazing wonder
enters with new force and richness into life itself.
Half a century ago Milton and Cheadle christened
it "a Giant among Giants, Immeasurably Supreme."  The
first ascent of Mount Robson was made only
as recently as in 1909 by the Rev. George Kinney
and Mr. Donald Phillips, their final success being the
outcome of a trial of twenty days, during which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
they were continually baffled and driven back by
adverse and seemingly impossible conditions.  But
the difference between success and failure may be
accurately defined as persistence of energy.  He who
gives up, fails; he who does not give up, succeeds.
It is only a question of time and of tenacity of
purpose.  Two unsuccessful attempts to ascend to
the summit of Mount Robson had been made in
1907-8.  There is a trail leading to the north side
of Mount Robson, along the Grand Fork River,
skirting the shore of Lake Helena and up through
the Valley of a Thousand Falls, with the celebrated
Emperor Falls within view, and thus on to Berg
Lake and to Robson Pass.  The trip to Berg Lake
can be made within one day, and it is an excursion
into regions of such marvellous beauty that can
never be translated into words.  In all this
bewildering sublimity the spellbound gazer can only
question, with Robert Service:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Have you seen God in His splendours? heard the text that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature renders?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Such fantasies of combination, too, as meet the
eye: castles, towers, fortresses, that glow like opal
and ruby and topaz; walls of sheer glaciers rising
in dazzling whiteness like a spectral caravan; formless
solitudes fit only for the abode of the gods!  The
spirit of the mountains is abroad on her revels; ice
peaks 10,000 feet in the upper air are her toys; the
winds are her Æolian harp; the Valley of a Thousand
Falls is her theatre for pastime.  Neither the Swiss
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
Alps, nor yet that mysterious chain of the Tyrol,
haunted by drifting cloudshapes and vocal with
rushing waterfalls, can compare with the colossal
scale of this splendour of all the Mount Robson
region.  It is the encountering of an entirely new
range of experiences.  It is Service again who
interprets one's emotional enthusiasms in the stanzas:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to gaze on?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,<br />
  Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blazon,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?<br />
  Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streaking through it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?<br />
  Have you strung your soul to silence?  Then for God's sake go<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do it;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.<br />

  Have you broken trail on snow-shoes? mushed your huskies up<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the river,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Strangest of all, in these stern mountain solitudes,
with their glittering crevasses of ice, there are
sheltered valleys all aglow with myriads of flowers
in brilliant and gorgeous hues; and here, at sunset,
peaks touched to gold and crimson are seen looming
up in the transparent air against a background
of intensely blue sky, a spectacle to inspire both
painter and poet with its unearthly beauty.
</p>

<p>
To traverse such a region as this amid the luxury
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
of the appointments of the Grand Trunk Pacific's
transcontinental trains seems at first an anomaly;
nothing is primitive save the forests primeval;
nothing wild but the scenery.  It is all a new universe,
somewhere between the once familiar earth and the
dream of Paradise&mdash;something by which to set the
compass of life to a new polarity.
</p>

<p>
An intrepid mountain climber, Miss Mary L. Jobe,
F.R.G.S., made a wonderful quest into these
Canadian Rockies recently, and explored a region
100 miles north-west of Mount Robson.  Of one
scene there Miss Jobe writes:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"A massive white peak shot into the blue from a walled
fortress of rock.  Two colossal rocky towers stood guard
over a file of lesser peaks; multi-coloured masses of granite,
glacier-hung, glowed with irridescent tints, while down a
valley rushed a foaming river to meet the cascades of
colour pouring from the mountain...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Between Mount Robson and Prince George (from
which young city a railway will soon be completed
linking it with Vancouver) the route on to
Prince Rupert follows the Fraser River, the waters
of which are a chrysolite green, the furious current
flecked with foam, while the Fraser, at one point,
transforms itself into a lake, seven miles wide, with
that easy power of compassing transformation
scenes, lightning changes, so to speak, of which the
rivers of the Dominion appear to hold the secret.
When a Canadian river grows tired of running, it
immediately turns itself into a lake.  When a
Canadian lake becomes tired of staying in the same place,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
it at once proceeds to become a river.  Just what
species of genii control the wilds of Canada has not
yet engaged the attention of her statisticians.  The
great Fraser River has its headquarters in the
Yellowhead, and flowing through a broad valley,
watering large fertile tracts of land, it makes its
progress to the Pacific 800 miles away.  The view of
this wonderful river from the railroad, as the line
passes high above the swirling waters, is a magnificent
one.  The Fraser has a beautiful bend at Prince
George, turning sharply to the south, while the
railway proceeds through another smiling valley,
the Nechako&mdash;a valley which is rich in plateau
lands favourable for agricultural uses, and along
whose course are numberless sylvan scenes that
lend to it great beauty.  Vanderhoof, the gateway to
all the region of lakes of British Columbia, is the
capital of the Nechako Valley.  The railway again
enters into the mountains, the Coast Range, in the
Bulkley Valley, and for a distance of 200 miles,
between Smithers and Prince Rupert, the view is
diversified by mountain peaks.  The Nechako and
Bulkley Rivers water fertile valleys of more than
6,000,000 of acres, easily cultivated and offering a
scenic setting unparalleled in the world.  Hazleton
is a prosperous and growing centre with an assured
future.  From this city the railway route follows the
Skeena River, which also has a trick of widening at
intervals.  The splendid train glides on and on, and
is it on the air that one seems to hear echoed:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star a-gleam to<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guide us,<br />
  And the wild is calling, calling ... let us go!"?<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The onward route is enthralling.  There comes in
sight La Riviere au Shuswap, a tributary of the
Fraser, with a vanishing view of three peaks close
together, far up the valley, as the train rushes past.
For it is not every mountain that can have a station
to itself, as has Mount Robson, thus giving the
passenger time to see its wonders with no little
satisfaction.  Before the junction of the Bulkley
and the Telkwa Rivers is reached, the railway passes
Lakes Decker and Burns; and at the junction of
the rivers mineral deposits of copper, silver, lead, and
coal have been discovered that promise rich leading.
Hudson Bay Mountain is a prominent peak, 9000
feet in height, and in this mountain also silver and
silver lead, copper, and anthracite coal are found;
and the Hudson Bay Glacier lies only four miles
from the railway track, easily reached on horseback.
The train runs close to the shore of Lake Kathlyn, a
lake filled with a black-spotted trout, and Hudson
Bay Mountain is repeated in the lake as in a mirror.

Bulkley Gate is something to see, if one may judge
by the contagious enthusiasm of the young train
agent who proceeds to announce it, with the pride
of a showman displaying his wares.  By just what
necromancy a railroad system magnetises every
employé, from the most important officials to
the youthful recruit, with its own courtesy and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
unanalysable charm in all the relations of service,
may not be revealed; but the result is very much
in evidence.
</p>

<p>
In all the hotels of this line, as well as upon
railroad lines, the duty, grace, and charm of courtesy
of manner are constantly inculcated.  To make the
service the best on the continent seems to be the
ideal of the staff through every grade and department.
Bulkley Gate proves itself quite worthy of its
young champion&mdash;a wonderful gate indeed, formed
by a dyke that formerly crossed the valley, and at
last gave way before the power of the river.  The
Skeena and the Bulkley Rivers unite near Hazleton,
and in close vicinity is the Rocher Deboule Mountain,
which is known as the Mountain of Minerals.  It
is extremely rich in copper ore, large quantities of
which have already been taken from it.  All along
the picturesque and turbulent Skeena River are
quaint Indian villages, with the totem poles of
their tribes.  Here also mountain peaks are much
in evidence, and in the spring of 1916 one of these,
9000 feet in height, was chosen to bear the name of
Mount Sir Robert, in honour of the Premier of
the Dominion, Sir Robert Borden.  A large glacier,
which seems to be at least a mile in width, has been
named Borden Glacier, and both the peak and the
glacier can be seen from Doreen station.
</p>

<p>
Thus is the entire route one of exceptional beauty
and never-failing interest.  From the first to the last
there is not a dull moment.  And in crossing the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
wonderful bridge that connects Kaien Island (on
which Prince Rupert stands) with the mainland,
the traveller finds something to enlist his enthusiasm
for science as well as that enlisted for nature.  This
bridge is nearly a thousand feet in length, and
includes six spans, two of which are of two hundred
and fifty feet each.  The engineers encountered
great difficulty, because of the furious racing of the
water through the channel, so that at times the
divers could not descend.  The conditions not
unfrequently reduced the working hours to little more
than three out of the twenty-four.
</p>

<p>
The construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific
that extended the western lines of the Grand Trunk
System from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert was
an epic story of the Dominion.  For it was really
one of the determining events of British Empire
history, as well as an exceptionally potent factor
in the contemporary development of Canada.  It
has not only changed the map of the country, but
also takes its place in international advancement.
To open a new and vast territory whose splendour
of scenery, incalculably marvellous resources, and
climatic conditions are such as to invite and sustain
immigration is an achievement that brings to bear
a signal influence upon the peoples of the entire
European continent and even upon the Orient.  It
was at once the opening of a new realm for human
life.  Education and culture are invited to enter.
It is hardly possible for the mind to grasp, or for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
the imagination to picture, all the possibilities of the
future that are initiated by so great an enterprise.
The Indian trail, the packhorse, the canoe, gave
way to the steel tracks, the luxurious trains of
vestibuled cars laden with civilisation advancing
into the wilderness.  A great Canadian railway
is not built to meet the recognised demands of
settlement.  It has to act as pioneer and create
the conditions that make settlement possible.
Its construction is, literally, the manifestation of
belief in the things not seen.  It is a creative power
prospecting for paths of national destiny.
</p>

<p>
The story of that reconnaissance through hundreds
of miles of an apparently impenetrable wilderness
is one to haunt the imagination.  It is a
story of hardships and of heroisms.  Emerson
declares that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The hero is not fed on sweets."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The pathfinder shares the usual experience that
invests heroism.
</p>

<p>
It is to Charles Melville Hays that the conception
of thus extending the Grand Trunk System is
primarily due.  Mr. Hays was endowed with the
"seeing eye."  He was gifted with that penetrating
order of comprehension that swiftly discriminates
between the possible and the impossible, and sets
the key of achievement accordingly.  He was not
infelicitously called "the Cecil Rhodes of Canada."  With
that same brilliant capacity to conceive new
combinations that build up new orders of life,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
Mr. Hays had that tenacity of purpose which alone
renders such conceptions available, and he had an
even larger power than that of the Empire builder in
Africa for relating his dream to definite conditions.
</p>

<p>
It is recorded that there came a morning in Canada
when the Dominion awakened "to experience a
thrill of excitement from the Atlantic to the
Pacific."  For the newspapers had announced that a new
Transcontinental railway was to be undertaken,
and that the Grand Trunk System was the initiator
of this stupendous scheme.  It seems that Mr. Hays
himself had conveyed to the press merely this
laconic statement overnight, and it was the spark
that incited a very conflagration of discussion.
There was an instantaneous public clamour whose
geographical limits were only defined from Halifax
and Vancouver, from Dawson to Hudson Bay.
But when the morning dawned, and the startlingly
interesting news incited the pursuit of the President
of the Grand Trunk System for fuller information,
that distinguished official had already boarded his
steamer and was fairly off on the high seas for
Europe.  The man at the head of a railway system
that, by the addition of its new western lines,
attains to no less than 8115 miles in extent, with
its inestimable potentialities of service, may well
be accorded rank among the notable figures whose
genius and courage have helped to shape the destiny
of the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
In the work of constructing this great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
trans-continental road, Mr. Hays called as his lieutenant,
in 1909, Mr. Edson Joseph Chamberlain.  Mr. Chamberlain
was Vice-President and General
Manager of the Grand Trunk Pacific for three busy
years, and after the tragedy of the <i>Titanic</i> in 1912,
he was called to succeed Mr. Hays as President of
the Grand Trunk System.
</p>

<p>
The chief engineer in charge of the construction
of the Grand Trunk Pacific was Mr. J. B. Kelliher.
With him went a party of gentlemen to make the
preliminary exploration after the surveyors had
made their pioneer report on the possibilities of the
route.  While they had secured a general impression
of the topography, the problems that remained were
intricate and manifold.

"In order to obtain a faint idea of the prospect
that confronted those entrusted with the reconnaissance,"
writes Frederick A. Talbot,[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] "conceive
a vast country rolling away in humps, towering
ridges, and wide-yawning valleys as far as the eye can
see, and with the knowledge that the horizon can be
moved onward for hundreds of miles without
bringing any welcome break in the outlook.  On every
hand is the interminable forest, a verdant sea, except
where here and there jagged splashes of black
betoken that the fire fiend has been at work.  The
trees swinging wave-like before the breeze conceal
dangers untold beneath their heavy, blanket-like
branches....  Here is a swamp whose treacherous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
mass stretches for mile after mile....  There is
a litter of jagged rock ... here a maze of fallen
tree trunks, levelled by wind, water, and fire, piled
up beneath the trees to a height of ten, fifteen, and
twenty feet in an inextricable mass, over which one
has to make one's way...."  Mr. Talbot graphically
describes that silence of the trackless solitudes:
"Not a sound beyond the sighing of the wind through
the trees, the rifle-like crack of a dead, gaunt monarch
as it crashes to the ground, or the howl of a wolf."  At
night the party slept in sleeping-bags; they had
scant provisions, too, because to carry an adequate
supply would have been an impediment to progress;
and after the quicksands, the impenetrable forests,
they would suddenly encounter some mad river or
vast lake; and at one cache where they arrived,
famished and weary, they found that wild animals
had broken in and destroyed the store of dried fruits,
fish, and canned food they had expected to find.
What a story is this record of pioneer work for the
selection of the route and the discovery of the most
favourable Pass for the construction of the Grand
Trunk Pacific!  There were many possible Passes
investigated before the decision was gradually
arrived at, by the process of elimination, to choose
that of the Yellowhead.  The number was first
reduced to four; the Wapiti, Pine River, Yellowhead,
and Peace River, and then Mr. Hays decided
on that of the Yellowhead.

<p>
"Our engineers have secured so easy a grade
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
through the Yellowhead Pass," said the Chairman
of the Board of Directors, "that when the traveller
takes the trip he will be no more conscious of
crossing a big mountain range, except for the magnificent
scenery, than he would be when he travels by the
London and North-Western or by the Great Eastern
Railway."
</p>

<p>
One interesting fact in connection with the
enormous enterprise of constructing this road was
the installation of temporary telephone facilities,
linking together the long line of construction camps
that trailed from Winnipeg to the coast.
</p>

<p>
Something of all this wonderful story comes
fragmentarily to the passenger whose interest is
aroused by the splendid construction of the road,
on which no effort was spared to secure permanence
and safety.  One feature that is always a noticeable
one to the traveller is that of the "milestones," so
to speak; the tall signs clearly inscribed with the
figures registering the miles as they are so rapidly
passed over.
</p>

<p>
Not only flowers and glaciers, sunsets and
tumbling cataracts, rocky pinnacles and frowning
ramparts, enchant a journey unrivalled on the continent,
but in the palace-train, whose cars are a series
of drawing-rooms in their luxurious appeal, there are
varied opportunities for studies of humanity, human
interest, and sympathies as well.  For example, in
one corner is an aged French Abbé, absorbed in his
breviary and in a richly bound volume which reveals
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
itself as the meditations of Fénelon.  The air of
detachment and scholarly isolation that he contrives
to throw around himself forbids even much speculation
as to whence he came or whither he is going&mdash;as
if even one's mental questioning might be an
intrusion.
</p>

<p>
At one little station, as the train stops, its
resplendent comfort contrasting strangely with the
primitive life of the newly-fledged village, there
enter a man and woman who have been attended
to the very steps of the vestibule by a throng that
apparently represents the entire population of the
town.  They are all singing, and the man and woman
linger in the vestibule joining in the song.  The man
is in the uniform of an officer of the Salvation Army;
the woman, sweet-faced and smiling, is also
costumed in this order, with the usual Salvation
Army bonnet projecting over her serene and pleasant
face.  The refrain of the song floats out on the air:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yes, we'll gather at the river,<br />
  That flows by the throne of God."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
There is something in the time, the place, the
isolation in the new and just-opened country through
which the train is passing, the on-coming darkness,
and the penetrating cadence of the trite and familiar
melody that touches every heart.  Every one joins
in the melody; and as the train begins to move, the
outer throng withdrawing into safer distance, the
man and the woman still leaning from the door of
the vestibule, there is a waving of hands, and a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
chorus of farewells from the vanishing group left
behind, and the train flies on to the benediction of
song that still pursues it on the air:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God be with you till we meet again!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The man and the woman catch up the line; they
are singing with melodious voices, the magnetism
enchains the passengers, and the cadence echoes
again through the railway car:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God be with you till we meet again!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was one of the little episodes that transcend
conventionalities and make strangers into friends.
The darkness is coming on; various nationalities,
various individualities&mdash;the elaborately outfitted
English tourist, the Reverend Abbé, the pioneer
settlers, the stately official on some mission of
Government, the college Professor with one eye on
the landscape in scientific scrutiny&mdash;yet all meeting
for the moment in a sense of their common heritage
as children of the Divine Father.
</p>

<p>
Later it was learned that the Salvation Army
officer and his sweet Scotch wife were none other
than Commissioner and Mrs. Charles Sowton, who
were on their way to open meetings in the little
Indian village of Metlakatla, near Prince Rupert,
going on later to Vancouver and Victoria.  The
Salvation Army is one of the features of the great
North-West.  A new territory had been created,
and Commissioner Sowton was appointed to
superintend all the activities of the army in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
country west of Port Arthur.  For more than
thirty years the Commissioner had been engaged
in Salvation Army work, during which period he
and Mrs. Sowton had been stationed in the British
Isles, Norway, India, and the United States in
turn.  On their arrival in Victoria on this trip,
Commissioner and Mrs. Sowton were given an
official reception, the Mayor and the City Council
joining with the people of the City to welcome these
faithful helpers of humanity.  In Vancouver, also,
a large meeting was held in the Pantages Theatre
in their honour, Mayor Taylor presiding and many
representative citizens being present.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the passengers on that particular train
fail to make friends with the wounded Canadian
soldier, a brave youth who had lost one arm in
service at the front, and thus crippled for life was
returning to his home at Prince Rupert.  To one
passenger who was deeply touched by his courage,
his youth, and his patriotism, he was moved to show
a little talisman that he carried in his pocket, an
envelope containing the prayer written by Lord
Roberts for the soldiers at the time of the South
African war:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"... If it be Thy will, enable us to win victory for
England, but, above all, grant us a better victory over
temptation and sin, over life and death, that we may be
more than conquerors through Him who loved us, and
laid down His life for us, Jesus, our Saviour, the Captain
of the army of God."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To his new friend the lad handed his signed card
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
of "Self-control; The Sake of Others, and for Love
of Christ and Country," the promise to abstain from
all intoxicating liquors, and to do all in his power
to promote good habits among his comrades.  And
there was his little card of personal prayer:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Almighty God, Grant me Thy power, and keep my
heart in Thy peace, help me to avoid evil, and be with me
in life and death, for Jesus' sake."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And the two, strangers but an hour before, were
drawn near as sharers of a common hope, a common
faith in the Divine care and leading.
</p>

<p>
On the arrival at Prince Rupert the populace
came out to meet the young soldier.  In him they
honoured all Canadian soldiers who were offering
their lives that their Empire might live and that
the freedom of humanity from Prussian tyranny
might be preserved.  There was more than one
band of music at the station, and musicians, soldiers,
and people joined in the war song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When my King and Country call me and I'm wanted at the front,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the shrapnel shells are bursting in the air;<br />
  When the foe in fury charges and we're sent to bear the brunt.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roll is called for service,&mdash;I'll be there!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When the Kaiser's lines are broken and his armies out of France,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Belgian desolation we repair;<br />
  When the final muster's ordered and the bugle sounds 'Advance'<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the God of Battles help me to be there!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When for me 'Last Post' is sounded and I cross the silent ford,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've a Pilot who of 'mine fields' will beware;<br />
  When 'Reveille' sounds in Heaven and the Armies of the Lord<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing the Hallelujah chorus,&mdash;I'll be there!"<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
</p>

<p>
No literature relating to the terrible struggle
could have brought home such an intense realisation
of the significance of the war, and the indomitable
courage and splendid loyalty of the Dominion, to
the passengers on that Grand Trunk Pacific train
as did these personal contacts and experiences.
Canada is not a military nation.  She desires to
follow the paths of peaceful progress and noble
development.  She has no enmities toward any race,
but she sees clearly the utter demoralisation of the
entire world if militarism and armaments are not
exterminated.  "The people of the British dominions
are animated by a stern resolve that there shall
be no such outcome," said Premier Borden in an
address before the New England Society, "and
they believe it possible to create a well-ordered
world whose harmony shall be based on a mutual
respect for common rights."

The wonderful journey, whose majestic splendour
so impressed itself upon individual life that, in a
sense, it could never be over, had its termination
at Prince Rupert.  There, again, one may watch
the rose and flame of dawn and the glory of colour
from terraced heights over-looking sea and land;
and in all the play of colour reflected from a thousand
waters he may almost find prefigured the twelve
gates of the Heavenly City that were all of pearl;
and the foundations of the wall which were
garnished with precious stones&mdash;jasper and sapphire,
emerald and chrysolite, and last&mdash;an amethyst!

CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
PRINCE RUPERT AND ALASKA
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Carlyle declared that when Robert Browning's
poem of <i>Sordello</i> appeared she read it through twice
with the deepest attention, but that at the
conclusion of the second reading she was utterly unable
to determine as to whether "Sordello" was a tree,
an island, or a man.  Somewhat of the same
bewilderment has beset many people of late years in
regard to any mention of Prince Rupert, the young
seaport of the great North-West.  One citizen
of the United States to whom a rather unusual
degree of cosmopolitan travel had been allotted by
the Fates that appointed his not undistinguished
destiny, and who enjoyed the well-earned admiration
of a host of friends as being pre-eminently entitled
to speak with authority on many abstract matters
for which those less erudite cared little and,
alas! knew less, assured his votaries, on inquiry, that
Prince Rupert was a town somewhere in the "Dolomites"
and that its title should be spelled with a
final "z"; while another cheerfully relegated
Prince Rupert to the maritime provinces of Canada.
Still another, who was nothing if not historical,
connected the name only with that of the son of
Frederick, Count Palatine of the Rhine, who was
created Duke of Cumberland in 1644 and who so
distinguished himself in scientific pursuits that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
was rewarded with a tomb in Westminster Abbey
(somewhere about 1682).  His portrait, painted by
Sir Peter Lely, is in the National Portrait Gallery
at London.  Not to prolong mere pleasantries,
however, the Prince Rupert whose citizens forecast for
it the future of the "Liverpool of America" is
really the terminal of that vast and splendid new
transcontinental highway, the Grand Trunk System.
</p>

<p>
Prince Rupert was really created in Boston
(U.S.A.), for before the dense forest covering the
rocky island with an almost impenetrable growth was
felled, the town was laid out by Messrs. Brett and
Hall, one of the most distinguished firms of landscape
architects in the United States.  As a result it is one
of the most charmingly designed cities of the entire
northern continent.  The scenic setting of Prince
Rupert is one of incomparable beauty, with its
ineffable glory of sea and sky, its hills and cliffs,
with terrace above terrace, a scenic setting that
suggests, and even rivals, that of Algiers, or Naples,
or Genoa, in that unique order of picturesque loveliness
investing the cities that rise from terraces above
blue seas, with architectural splendours silhouetted
against the sapphire sky.
</p>

<p>
Kaien Island, upon which the main part of the
city will stand, comprises some 28 square miles
lying 550 miles north of Vancouver.  From the
magnificent harbour the island rises imperiously,
dominated by its central peak, Mount Hays, which
towers to some 2300 feet in the clear air, with a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
grandeur of outlook that the artistic genius of
Messrs. Brett and Hall admirably utilised in a way that insures
the young city so novel and delightful a background.
From Mount Hays the view over the harbour, the
islands, and the far waters of the Pacific, and over
lakes, forests, and rivers on the mainlands, is a view
to be included among the noblest scenic delights of
the world.  No more romantic panorama discloses
itself from Amalfi, Hong Kong, or from the Acropolis
of Athens.  Nor is Prince Rupert icebound and
stormbound in the winter, for the Japanese current
that washes the shores insures an open harbour all
the year round.  The entrance to the bay is singularly
commodious and is usually free from fog.  The
harbour of Prince Rupert has every claim to be
considered one of the finest in the world.
</p>

<p>
The task on which Messrs. Brett and Hall entered
was a novel one.  It was nothing less than the creation
of a city seen in ideal vision.  On the actual site was
a waste and wild of rocks and stones, of tangled
undergrowth and huge stumps of trees that had been
felled.  The mountain, also, had to be reckoned with,
and even if the Boston landscape experts had
possessed that traditional faith which is said to be able
to remove mountains, they did not wish to remove
Mount Hays.  Like Mount Royal, in stately, splendid
Montreal, the mountain was the most picturesque
of assets.  Here and there some giant tree had escaped
the fate of its companions, and stood as if contemplating
their fate.  The uncompromising debris, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
rocky sub-stratum, the abounding mass of loose
stone, all combined to present difficulties.  "Prince
Rupert!  A town hewn out of solid rock," has since
that day been the description of the new city, quoted
with appreciative interest.
</p>

<p>
How did Messrs. Hall and Brett attack the
problem?  It was a complexity of topography that
baffled, if it did not defy, solutions.  But Nature
yields, perforce, to the necromancy of genius, and
the initial achievement was to create a series of
planes, planes level, planes inclined, and they then
discovered that the trend of all these was, naturally,
from north-east to south-west.  Nature smiled upon
them to the degree of establishing the means for
all these planes to be, approximately, parallel in
direction.  Doubtless these landscape creators (being
Bostonians) congratulated themselves in true
Emersonian phrase on the truth that:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "... the world is built in order<br />
  And the atoms march in tune."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This stupendous work was first entered upon by
the architects in January of 1908, the preliminary
hydrographic and topographic surveys having been
made in the two previous years by a large engineering
force under the direction of James H. Bacon, the
Harbour Engineer of the Grand Trunk Pacific.  The
planes being appropriately parallel allowed rectangular
systems of blocks for building, thus offering
the best facilities for traffic; and the lie of the
land permitted the splendid, spacious avenues with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
charm of vista and vast perspective, in combination
with curving streets of limited crescents, so
attractive for the residential part of the city.  Beside
Mount Hays Park, other plaza reservations were
made, squares and playgrounds being especially
considered.  Along Hays Creek was a wonderful
natural park which was utilised, and there has
perhaps seldom been a combination of art and
nature more artistically blended.
</p>

<p>
For the most beautiful residential section the
eastern end of Kaien Island was selected.  Connecting
this residential region with the business section
was a broad highway called Prince Rupert Boulevard,
which also formed a link in a circular drive of
twenty miles, extending around the island.  There
is a superb view obtained from here over Lake Morse
and Lake Wainwright, and in this transparent air,
under a glowing sky, this view alone would be a
signal inspiration to painter or poet.  For Prince
Rupert is one of the most ideally enchanting places
to be found on any shore; and one of the notable
drives of the world, hardly even excepting that
picturesque and romantic pilgrimage route between
Sorrento and Amalfi, is found in Prince Rupert
Boulevard in its connection with Lake Avenue.  These
shores of all the marvellous North-West are only
comparable with those of Italy in their ineffable charm.
</p>

<p>
It is not alone, however, for the romance of beauty
that Prince Rupert is notable.  This brilliant young
city is destined to be a traffic centre of great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
proportions and of cosmopolitan importance.  It will
inevitably become the emporium of Alaska and
of all the great Northern region.  The port is but
thirty miles south of the Alaskan boundary, and it is
thus the natural starting-point for Dawson, Nome,
and other of the Alaskan and Yukon centres.  From
Prince Rupert to New York or to Boston or to
Chicago there is now this direct line through
Edmonton and Winnipeg, and thus it cannot but become
a great international port.  Prince Rupert is four
hundred miles nearer to Yokohama than is
Vancouver, and it is six hundred miles less than by
way of San Francisco.  Since the completion of
the Grand Trunk Pacific this route has offered the
shortest and most direct route to the Yukon and
to Alaska.  The first train over the new extension of
the Grand Trunk from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert
arrived at this port on April 9, 1914, a date not
unimportant in the history of progress in Canada, as
it initiated conditions which inaugurate an entirely
new era in its prosperous development.
</p>

<p>
This romantic young city has the distinction of
having had more time and money devoted to its
design than has perhaps ever before been bestowed
upon a town seen only in vision.  Henri Bergson
might almost point to it as an illustration of his
creative evolution.  Before the opening of the town
site, plank sidewalks and roadways, sewers and
water mains, and other municipal facilities for the
sanitary welfare and the comfort of ten thousand
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
people were constructed.  At the present time in
this city, which only celebrated its ninth birthday
in January 1917, there are already seven thousand
inhabitants.  There are three daily newspapers, the
<i>News</i>, <i>Journal</i>, and <i>Empire</i>.  There are five banks,
branches of the Bank of Montreal, Canadian Bank
of Commerce, Union Bank of Canada, the Royal,
and the Bank of British North America.  Two clubs,
the Prince Rupert and the Pioneer, have each
attractive houses of their own, and include in their
membership the leading professional and business
men of the city.
</p>

<p>
The harbour is equipped for the most modern
and exacting requirements.  It might well be called
the harbour for the ships from the Seven Seas.  The
Grand Trunk Pacific Steamship Company have also
established a splendid service between Skagway,
Prince Rupert, and Seattle, the <i>Prince Rupert</i> and
the <i>Prince George</i> providing all the comforts of the
best ocean liners, and offering scenery on the voyage
that is so resplendent a feature with its perpetual
surprises.  Prince Rupert has an exceptionally high
order of population, people of education, refinement,
energy, and enterprise.  Churches abound; the schools
are the pride of the city; the social life is interesting
and especially distinctive in having so large a
preponderance of cultivated people.
</p>

<p>
The fishing industry at Prince Rupert is already
one of the most important and the cold storage
plant is one of the largest on the continent.  There is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
a vast cannery interest, for the salmon pack of the
Skeena River has established itself with the public
as being of a finer order than salmon caught farther
south.  Prince Rupert is already the acknowledged
centre of the Skeena salmon fishery, there being
twelve manufactories on the river, employing twelve
hundred boats in constant service and more than
five thousand labourers, women as well as men
working in this industry.  The halibut landed at the
port in the first nine months of 1916 amounted to
11,667,300 lbs.
</p>

<p>
Prince Rupert has, also, another important
commercial asset in its pulpwood.  Untold quantities
of valuable timber are at its very doors.  Mining
industries, too, are forecast, as it is believed that
there is much rich ore in the adjacent region,
and a smelter is already projected.  All these,
however, are held as subordinate in any case to the
commercial possibilities of the city which promise
an undoubted destiny.  The Skeena River is one of
the invaluable assets, increasing all traffic
conveniences for fruit-raising and agricultural
production, and offering a waterway delightful for
excursions and explorations.  The completion of the
Grand Trunk Pacific has brought the eastern portion
of the United States and Alaska forty-eight hours
nearer to each other through Chicago, and has
greatly enhanced the commercial interests between
the two countries.  The climate of Prince Rupert has
a remarkably even temperature, averaging in summer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
about seventy-seven degrees, and the coldest record
in any winter (this one being exceptional) was that
of eight degrees below zero.  As a rule the winter
temperature does not reach so low a degree.  The
climate thus permits much out-of-door life and is
perhaps not an altogether negligible factor in the
easy grace of social intercourse.  The town has the
beginning of a library, and more than one magazine
and reading club.  "To open a door, to widen the
horizon, this is human service of the highest order."  The
creation of Prince Rupert is well calculated to
rank high in this service.

<p>
One of the interesting features of this town,
which is one full of surprises lying in wait for
the alert and expectant traveller, is the great dry
dock of the Grand Trunk Pacific and Ship Repair
Company, which has cost something like three
million dollars, and was completed in 1915.  This
ship-building and repair plant is virtually three docks
in one; and it can handle a ship of twenty thousand
tons displacement and a length of six hundred feet,
drawing thirty feet of water; moreover, it can deal
with three ships at a time.  It has derricks that can
lift out, for repair, boilers weighing sixty tons, and
after passing them through the shops replace them
in the ship.  It also furnishes power, light, compressed
air, with wharf and storage space.  The dock, in
conjunction with the machine and the repair shops,
can handle any class of work, wood or steel, boilers
or any kind of mechanism.  During its construction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
over a hundred and fifty men were employed, with
a pay-roll that ran to some twelve thousand dollars
a month.  The inestimable convenience of such a
plant for vessels in these waters in need of repair
can hardly be over-estimated.
</p>

<p>
In June 1915 the great enterprise was undertaken
across the harbour opposite Prince Rupert of
clearing seven hundred acres for residential use.
Within three months one hundred acres of this was
prepared, but from causes connected with the war,
and temporary conditions of finance, the entire
completion of the work is delayed for a time.  In
Prince Rupert the site for the magnificent terminal
station is already cleared; and when the war shall
be ended and conditions in the Dominion resume
their prosperity, these buildings will be erected.
The telegraph service of Prince Rupert is admirable.
There is a direct service establishing through
communication with the East, and the rates between
Prince Rupert and Vancouver have been reduced to
one dollar for a ten-word message.  There is direct
communication by telephone with Hazleton, Skeena
Crossing, and with the mine of the Montana Development
Company at Carnaby.
</p>

<p>
The civic affairs of Prince Rupert are well
administered.  The city has adopted the single-tax plan.
It owns its electric lighting and power, its telephone
and water systems.  The fire department is equipped
with the most modern appliances.  It has twenty-one
miles of planked roadways; it has five miles of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
plank pavements for pedestrians; and has already
three miles of sewers.  Five parks aggregate nearly
a hundred acres of reservation for the city's
recreation.
</p>

<p>
The lumber industry in British Columbia is one
of the utmost importance as the northern part of the
province alone produces an annual output of some
twelve million feet.  The southern portion of the
province also makes considerable shipments.  The
Forestry Department of the Provincial Government
of the Dominion report that there is available, in
Prince Rupert district, twenty-five million acres
averaging over fifteen thousand feet to the acre.  In
addition there is a tract which will be available for
commercial purposes, within the next half century,
of an area of seventeen million acres.  About half
this timber is spruce, red cedar and hemlock come
next in order, and there is perhaps ten per cent. of
balsam and yellow cedar.  The cannery repairs
and boxes required for the salmon pack and for the
halibut trade make enormous demands on lumber.
This branch of commerce was completely
transformed by the completion of the Grand Trunk
Pacific.  It enabled Prince Rupert to compete on an
equal basis with many other points, for a direct
railroad line running through the centre of the
Prairie Provinces to Winnipeg, and especially a
railroad that has a better grade and shorter haul than
any other with which it competes, places Prince
Rupert on a fortunate basis with regard to markets.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is hardly possible to estimate the future that
lies before Prince Rupert.  As tributary resources
it has an ocean and an Empire.  To its port will
come the ships from all countries.  They will bring
products from the East, of the various far-off
continents, and they will sail away laden with lumber
and the rich exports of the vast North-West.  Never
was a city more skilfully planned.  The Dominion
Government's Hydrographic Survey had made a
complete survey of Prince Rupert Harbour and its
approaches, discovering that from the entrance to
the extreme end, a distance of fourteen miles, it
was entirely free from rocks or obstructions of any
kind, and that the depth afforded ample anchorage.
The Provincial Government of British Columbia
appropriated two hundred thousand dollars for
preliminary improvements, in the construction of
roads and pavements, of sewers and water mains,
before the town site was opened.  While the
Provincial Government makes Prince Rupert its
headquarters for the northern part of the Province, with
a court-house and buildings for offices, the Dominion
Government is erecting a permanent and handsome
post-office and customs house.  Surrounded by a
country whose richness and variety of resources are
beyond comparison, its rapid growth is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
The easy proximity of Prince Rupert to Alaska
is one of the most important things in connection
with this unique and brilliant young seaport of the
Pacific.  Seattle and Skagway are 1000 miles apart,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
and thus the round trip between Seattle and Skagway
is 2000 miles; but from Prince Rupert to Skagway
is of course a sail of far less distance.  The trip
is one of entrancing scenery, fiords, bays all
mountain-locked in supreme majesty and beauty, arms
of the sea extending into coast indentations with
an unexcelled panorama of glancing lights, play of
colours, and moving-picture panoramas of grandeur
and picturesqueness.  Between Seattle, Prince
Rupert, and Skagway the entire round trip occupies
some eleven days.  It is a voyage unmatched on the
entire globe.  In the distance the towering peaks
clothed in snow of dazzling whiteness rise beyond
the mountain ranges in their royal purple with
evanescent flitting gleams of gold and rose from the
brilliant sun; the green water of the bays is alive
with thousands of leaping salmon; and the shores
are defined by the dark pine forests, standing in an
impenetrable tangle of ferns and trailing
undergrowth.  Through this "Inside Passage," as it is
called, a fleet of steamers has been employed by
the Grand Trunk Pacific in a splendid coast service
between Seattle and Skagway.  "I am in the writing-room
on the upper deck of the <i>Prince George</i> sailing
amid such ineffable glory that I only write about
one word to every ten minutes," said an enthusiastic
voyager in a personal letter to a friend in the early
September days of 1915; "only one word in ten
minutes will be allotted to you, for I must LOOK!
It is the time of my life, and I can write letters (at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
all events to you, to whom they write themselves)
anywhere.  But this voyage&mdash;it is the dream of a
lifetime!  I have sailed the enchanted Mediterranean
with our rapturous callings at Algiers, rising on
terraced hills in her unspeakable beauty; at Naples,
with all the Neapolitan coast a very vision of the
ethereal realms; I have sailed on to Genoa, with
Ischia, dream-haunted by Victoria Colonna, Italy's
immortal woman-poet, and made my pilgrimage to
the island and over the ancient Castel d'Ischia by
local boats from Naples; I once sailed through the
Ionian Isles in the late afternoon of a May day that
was all azure and gold; I have sailed the Italian
lakes and cruised about on the Alpine lakes of
Switzerland: but it still remained for this one
enchanted voyaging to give me that thrill of
untranslatable ecstasy.  This combination of the sea and
mountains in what they call the 'Inside Passage'
is simply superb.  And the <i>Prince George</i> is perfectly
ideal in all conditions.
</p>

<p>
"I have a large, beautiful state-room alone&mdash;every
state-room on these steamers is an outside one; the
entire steamer is richly carpeted in soft moss-green;
finished in the native woods, polished till you could
use the woodwork for a mirror (and if it reflected you
how decorative it would be!); beside that, there are
mirrors galore, of the regulation order, and a
news-stand with all the world's literature, so to speak;
the most delightful bathrooms, but I don't spend
the entire time at sea in salt baths, as you unkindly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
assert; the table is excellent, being rather noted, I
am told, for its fine cuisine, and there is to me a
very direct connection between delicious coffee and
various accompaniments, and feeling 'up' to
things for the day; anyway, everything is delicious,
and the splendid, spacious decks to enjoy a paradise
of walking on; writing-desks well stocked with
stationery at every turn, on every deck; and these
steamers are 'twin-screw' if you know what that
means!  I confess I don't! but apparently people
who do know consider a 'twin' screw as of far more
importance in the universe than one lone, lorn screw;
and they are equipped with wireless telegraph (I do
know what that means) and with oil engines, and
every modern device of safety, and with fairly
luxurious comfort; and, indeed, the whole voyage
is ideal and has only one fault&mdash;alas! alas! that it
will come to an end.  If only it would never end!  I
count off the flying hours as a miser counts his gold,
I can hardly bear to sleep to miss one hour of its
glory and loveliness, yet sleep, too, is a joy in this
magical air, and, at all events, this voyage will not
be ended when it is over.  I shall have it all the rest of
my life ... to live over again and again 'in the
ethereal,' where all outer experiences find their
record.  I am quite sure the Recording Angel sets
this down in illuminated pages."
</p>

<p>
From Puget Sound 500 miles of the voyage is
through Canadian waters, so vast is the Dominion.
For one hundred and twenty miles the steamer is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
sailing through the Straits of Georgia, which
separates the main land of British Columbia from
Vancouver Island, with the range of the Olympic
Mountains astern, from whence the gods look down
on mortals.  Do they not, indeed, dwell on Olympian
heights?  Passing into the Seymour Narrows from
the Georgian Strait, the Channel is hardly more
than one third of a mile wide, and the rocky walls
with the lofty mountains just behind are so
overgrown with trees as to present an almost solid wall
of emerald green, tempting the passenger to reach
out his hand and grasp the cedar needles that seem
so near.  On sunny days the reflections in the water
are bewilderingly clear, and here and there pour
down rushing cataracts of foam-crested water from
the melting snow of the mountains.

"Queen Charlotte Sound," writes Ella Higginson,[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>] "is
a splendid sweep of purple water....  The warm breath
of the Kuro Siwo, penetrating all these inland seas and
passages, is converted by the great white peaks of the
horizon into pearl-like mist that drifts in clouds and
fragments upon the blue waters.  Nowhere are these mists
more frequent, nor more elusive, than in Queen Charlotte
Sound.  At sunrise they take on the delicate tones of the
primrose or the pinkish star-flower; at sunset, all the royal
rose and purple blendings; all the warm flushes of amber,
orange, and gold.  Through a maze of pale yellow, whose
fine, cool needles sting one's face and set one's hair with
seed pearls, one passes into a little open water-world where
a blue sky sparkles above a bluer sea, and the air is like
clear, washed gold.  But a mile ahead a solid wall of amethyst
closes in this brilliant sea; shattering it into particles that

Forty miles north of Prince Rupert is Dixon's
Entrance, that marks the international boundary
between the Canadian and Alaskan waters.  Some
haunting impress left upon the air by the great
navigators who made their pioneer voyages in these
intricate waterways&mdash;Perez and Valdez, Duncan,
Vancouver, Meares, Caudra&mdash;their dauntless courage
and their perils fling spectra on the passing winds
and waves.  The scenic effects grow more and more
sublime as the steamer advances.  At a distance of
about seventy-five miles north of Prince Rupert the
traveller comes in sight of a remarkable series of
mountain terraces, rising more than six thousand
feet into the air, with sheer walls and castellated
summits.
</p>

<p>
The first call at port after Prince Rupert is at
Ketchikan, seven hundred miles from Seattle, with
a population of some two thousand people, the
distributing point for the mines and fisheries of
Southern Alaska.  On its crescent-shaped harbour
and with its eternal guard of mountains, with its
lake and its falls and its wonderful gorge, three
miles distant into the woodlands, it is a picturesque
town, and with its electric lighting and steam
heating it leaves little to be desired for comfortable
residence.  Between Ketchikan and Wrangell are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
the Wrangell Narrows, a channel where ethereal
vapours, many-hued, like tropical flowers, are
breeze-blown in the air; and the long, green moss,
on the trees on either side, sways like drapery.
Miss Scidmore, writing of Wrangell Narrows, thus
pictured it with her fascinating pen:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"It was an enchanting trip up that narrow channel of
deep water, rippling between bold island shores and
parallel mountain walls.  Beside clear emerald tide,
reflecting tree and rock, there was the beauty of foaming
cataracts leaping down the sides of snow-capped
mountains and the grandeur of great glaciers pushing down
through sharp ravines and dropping miniature icebergs
into the sea.  Touched by the last light of the sun, Patterson
Glacier was a frozen lake of a wonderland, shining with
silvery lights, and showing a pale ethereal green and deep,
pure blue in all the rifts and crevices of its icy front."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From Wrangell on to Juneau the entrance to
Taku Inlet is passed.  The far-famed Taku Glacier
is differentiated by the extreme brilliancy of its
colouring from all other glaciers of the Alaskan
regions.  Taku Inlet, with its forty-five ice streams,
is a fitting approach to this marvel of Nature.
Every blast of the steamer's whistle is as the call
of a giant monster which is answered by masses of
ice that, detached by the vibration, plunge headlong
into the sea with a noise like thunder.  "That day
on the Taku Glacier will live forever as one of the
rarest and most perfect enjoyment," again writes
Alaska's vivid interpreter, Miss Scidmore: "The
grandest objects in Nature were before us, the
primeval forces that mould the face of the earth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
were at work, and it was all so out of the every-day
world that we might have been walking a new planet,
fresh fallen from the Creator's hand."  The Taku
Glacier has a sheer, precipitous front three hundred
feet high, the colour making it seem one gigantic
sapphire, so intense is the blue.  Yet again there are
glints of green and rose and gold that flash out as if
a casket of jewels had been flung over it, or an
avalanche of star-dust, windswept, from the far
spaces of the universe.  John Muir, the great naturalist,
whose vision was that of the artist and whose
spirit was always open to the message of the eternal
world, was deeply impressed by Taku and by
Sundum fiords, and in one allusion he says of Taku:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"A hundred or more glaciers of the second and third
class may be seen along these walls, and as many snowy
cataracts, which, with the plunging bergs, keep all the
fiord in a roar.  The scenery is of the wildest description,
especially in their upper reaches, where the granite walls,
streaked with waterfalls, rise in sheer massive precipices,
like those of Yosemite Valley, to a height of three and
four thousand feet."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The poetic eye of John Burroughs keenly recognised
the grandeur of all this voyage and the especial
splendour that lies between Prince Rupert and
Skagway; and of the gleaming brilliancy of the
glacier regions he said that it was as if "the solid
earth became spiritual and translucent."
</p>

<p>
This new route to Alaska, which is under the
auspices of the Grand Trunk Pacific, has greatly
increased the tourist travel, as the safety of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
"Inside Route," combined with the luxurious
conditions and the ineffable panorama of beauty,
render the journey as easy and feasible as it is
delightful.  There is a saving of three days by
journeying over the Grand Trunk Pacific to Prince Rupert
and there embarking for Alaska.  In January of
1916, the well-known traveller and writer,
Mr. Frank G. Carpenter, made this trip of which he
wrote:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"... I despair of giving you any idea of the beauties
of this voyage, they are so many and so varied.  Now you
have the wonders of the Swiss Lakes, now those of the
Inland Sea of Japan, and now beauties like those on the
coasts of New Zealand.  There are all sorts of combinations
of sea and sky, of evergreen slopes and snow-capped
mountains.  The colour effects are beyond description and the
sunsets indescribable in their changes and beauties.  The
islands are of all shapes and sizes and they float upon
sapphire seas.  Many of the islands have snow-capped
mountains that rise in green walls almost straight up from
the water, and their heads are often crested with silver."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Juneau, the capital and principal metropolis of
Alaska, is on Gastineau Channel, which is eight
miles in length and more than a mile wide at the
entrance, gradually growing less as it nears the
mainland, till it becomes like a narrow avenue of
blue water through which the sunset pours in the
late afternoon with an almost unearthly beauty.
Mount Juneau, in the centre of the town, rises to a
height of 3000 feet, with sloping sides of a pale green
down which rush numberless cascades of silvery,
sparkling water.  Juneau is already an important
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
business centre, with incalculably rich mining
properties tributary to the city, and with almost
every branch of business and the industries represented.
It is the commercial supply centre of all the
camps; it is on the direct line of travel from Seattle
to the Upper Yukon, and has its banks, assay
laboratories, transportation facilities, and good schools,
while it is the residence of the Governor of Alaska
and the seat of all the Federal offices.  There is a
Chamber of Commerce, and there are women's clubs
and imported gowns.  The hospitalities of Juneau
are already famous, and social life rises to a gaiety
and whirl that leaves the Parisian life, as it existed
in its social tide before the war, quite in the shade.
The Parisienne is seldom reckless in her extravagance;
a certain well-adjusted economy is a part of
French life, even among the most fashionable and
wealthy.  But economy can hardly be said to have
achieved much for itself in Juneau.  Is not Alaska
stuffed with gold?  Not a few of its residents live as
if that conviction were their financial basis.  The
entertaining is on a lavish scale; the women are
dressed so smartly as to put a modest traveller quite
to rout; and money is apparently regarded as
something to be put into immediate circulation.
</p>

<p>
Life is at high tide.  Juneau has a creditable library,
it has several cleverly edited newspapers, and the
general vitality of the social and commercial life
is not unworthy of the sparkling splendours of the
scenic setting.  As Juneau was founded in 1880, its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
initial mining camp developing towards a town,
the period of its existence that antedates the dawn
of the twentieth century is regarded by its up-to-date
residents as ancient history.  The Rome of the
fifth century is not more remote from the Rome of
1916 than is the decade of the 'eighties from Juneau.
The people are the true "futurists" in every sense.
No grass grows under their glancing feet.  They drive,
and dress, and dine, and dance.  They begin where
the older cities leave off, so to speak.  If they are
remote from the great world centres, so much the
worse for the same centres!  Life is perpetually <i>en
fête</i> in Juneau.  The vital exhilaration, the sparkling
energy, the eye on the future, and the disregard of
the past, are characteristics of the general march
of progress.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to recall that the first book ever
written on Alaska was by Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore
of Washington, the capital of the United States, a
book published by the Lothrop house in Boston
(U.S.A.) early in the decade of 1880-90.  Miss
Scidmore was the first American woman to visit
Alaska, sailing from San Francisco by a freight
steamer some time before any passenger service was
inaugurated for that wonderful voyage.  An adventurous
spirit, her eager imagination always flitting
before to penetrate some unknown region, Miss
Scidmore thus began, in her early girlhood, the
extensive and somewhat remarkable travels which
have been continued in her picturesque life.  Since
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
those days of her first youthful achievement her
name has flown widely on the wings of fame as that
of one of the most brilliant and able women writers
of her country.  Taking the Orient for her happy
hunting-ground, Miss Scidmore has made numerous
voyages over the Pacific, with many prolonged
sojourns in China, Japan, and India; making a
pilgrimage to Java and writing of its old temples
and mysterious customs in a richly illustrated paper
that appeared in the <i>Century Magazine</i> and which
attracted wide attention.  Among her books <i>A
Winter in China</i> and <i>Jinrikisha Days</i> have come to
be regarded as almost indispensable handbooks for
travellers as well as the enchanters of the fireside
or the summer piazza; and by means of many
years' residence in Tokio and Yokohama, Miss
Scidmore has become an acknowledged authority
on Oriental art, a connoisseur whose judgment
has been sought by more than one of the great art
collectors in the States.  With her keen intellectual
grasp she has also entered into the politics of the
Far East; and to <i>The Outlook</i>, and other leading
reviews in both London and New York, Miss Scidmore
has contributed articles so able in their
discernment as to be widely quoted and discussed.
</p>

<p>
Miss Scidmore's initial trip to Alaska, interpreted
in a book offering a series of singularly vivid
impressions, combined, too, with a study of facts
and prevailing conditions, and fascinating pictorial
descriptions of this "water-colour land" as she
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
termed it, from the faint evanescent hues of sunshine
on the glaciers, perhaps contributed more than
any other single cause to stimulate the demand for
passenger excursions to this country.
</p>

<p>
Miss Scidmore's description of Muir Glacier, an
exquisite piece of word-painting, has often been
reproduced; and of her last, lingering view of this
spectacle she wrote:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The whole brow was transfigured with the fires of sunset;
the blue and silvery pinnacles, the white and shining
front dreamlike on a roseate and amber sea, and the range
and circle of dull violet mountains lifting their glowing
summits into a sky flecked with crimson and gold."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Somewhere about 1889 another gifted American
woman, Kate Field, author, lecturer, and a charming
figure in society, visited Alaska; and to Miss Field
belongs the honour of having delivered the first
lecture ever given in that country.  It was in Juneau,
in a primitive and unfinished room, that Miss Field
gave this lecture, utilising a rough table as a
platform.  Her audience included miners in their working
garb, prospectors, many of the usual camp-followers,
a few Indians, and several of her fellow-passengers
from the steamer.  Her theme was that of good
citizenship, and one of her hearers afterwards reported
that she gave them wholesome truths with characteristic
vehemence and earnestness.  Miss Field was
rewarded by being presented with the "freedom"
of the town (then hardly more than a mining-camp),
with a pair of silver bracelets made by the Indians,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
a bottle of virgin gold, and a totem pole.  These
picturesque tributes were highly valued by their
witty and graceful recipient, and she often displayed
them with pride and pleasure to her friends in
Washington, New York, Paris, or London.  Visiting
the Muir Glacier at this early period when its
unequalled grandeur was at its perfection (for of
late years earthquakes and devastations have
changed its contour) Miss Field thus described it:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Imagine a glacier three miles wide and three hundred
feet high, and you have a slight idea of Muir Glacier.
Picture a background of mountains fifteen thousand feet
high, all snow-clad, and then imagine a gorgeous sun
lighting up crystals with rainbow colouring.  The face of the
crystal takes on the hue of aquamarine&mdash;the hue of every
bit of floating ice that surrounds the steamer.  This dazzling
serpent moves sixty-four feet a day, tumbling headlong
into the sea, startling the air with submarine thunder."

</p>

<p>
Miss Field's experience in Juneau must have
been, indeed, a contrast to the scenic setting of her
girlhood, when, in Florence, Italy, she studied music
and art; where Walter Savage Landor taught her
Latin and wrote classic verse to her; where Robert
and Elizabeth Barrett Browning welcomed her to
their poets' home in Casa Guidi; and where she met
George Eliot, whose genius kindled her own.  With
her literary talent stimulated and all aglow in this
radiant atmosphere, Miss Field wrote that exquisite
series of monographs on Landor, Mrs. Browning,
Madame la Marchesa Ristori, and several of the
Italian poets, which were published in the <i>Atlantic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
Monthly</i> (then the magazine which was the very
arbiter of American literary destiny), a series that
has been often erroneously attributed to the eminent
sculptor and poet, William Wetmore Story, as in those
days the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> preserved the silence of
the gods regarding the identity of its contributors.
</p>

<p>
It is something to have passed one's early youth
in Arcady; and between those Florentine days, and
her appearance as the first lecturer in Alaska, there
lay a series of richly varied years and achievements.
Kate Field seemed to be always winging her shining
way, and it was during an interlude in Hawaii,
whose beauty steeped her in gladness, that she fared
forth, on a golden day in the Maytime of 1896, on
still another journey; a mystic journey into those
realms of the Life More Abundant, and entered on a
new phase of experiences, even those of the
Adventure Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
From Juneau the Grand Trunk Pacific Line of
steamers proceeds to Skagway, through the Lynn
Canal, considered, all in all, the most beautiful of
the fiords of Alaska.  Skagway rejoices in the poetic
designation of "the flower City of Alaska" from
the amazing luxuriance and loveliness of the riotous
floral growth in the gardens of the town and also in
the outlying country.  Skagway is the gateway to
the Yukon, and the tourist who wishes to visit
Canada's portion of this great Northland embarks
on the White Pass and Yukon Railway, which
affords easy access to Lake Atlin and down the
Yukon to Dawson, the capital of Yukon Territory.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
</p>

<p>
The future importance of Skagway depends
largely on the success of the White Pass and Yukon
Railway.  Of this, however, there is practically no
question.  Skagway has a population of more than
two thousand; and it is splendidly equipped with
cable, telephone and telegraph services; with electric
lighting; with good schools and churches; and with
shops and stores furnishing an adequate assortment
for all needs of utility and of taste and beauty;
it has a very attractive resident region, and its
gardens are already famous.  During the Klondike
excitement of 1897-98, Skagway was the base of
operations for many thousands of prospectors
who thronged this region.  It is especially attractive
to the devotees of ethnological science, as it
is near some of the more interesting Indian villages,
and it has supreme attractions for the artist.  The
glaciers of Davidson and Mendenhall are near, and
nowhere are the enchantments of a summer in the
far northlands more alluring and spellbinding to
the lover of flowers and fragrances, of stars and
sunsets, of the beauty that flashes from solid
mountain walls of opal pinnacles and glittering
palisades, in an atmosphere prismatic in
colour&mdash;nowhere are there more lovely "lands of summer
beyond the sea" than in and around Skagway.
</p>

<p>
It has been more or less generally supposed that
the climate of Alaska was inevitably severe and
fairly arctic in its character.  On the contrary, the
mean temperature of Juneau for July is fifty-seven
degrees and the thermometer often ranges from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
seventy to even ninety.  Thus the mean temperature
of Juneau for July is only one degree less than that
of San Francisco for August.  The equability of the
temperature in Southern Alaska is a feature of
importance.  The entire land, in summer, is covered
with a dense vegetation.
</p>

<p>
One of the great marvels of nature in the Alaskan
and Yukon regions is that of the matchless spectacle
of the Northern Lights.  Not even the glacier can
rival Aurora Borealis.  It is Robert Service who is
the bard of the mystic illuminations that are fairly
before the eye of the reader of that scintillating
poem, the "Ballad of the Northern Lights."

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
  PRINCE RUPERT TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA, SEATTLE,<br />
  AND THE GOLDEN GATE<br />
</h3>

<p>
The voyage from Prince Rupert to Alaska is unparalleled
in its glory of scenic enthralment; it is a trip
unique and, indeed, quite unrivalled by any that
this terrestrial sphere has disclosed to the wanderer
over her spaces; yet hardly less interesting in a
different way is that lovely sail of two days and
two nights from Prince Rupert to Seattle, with calls
at the ports of Vancouver and Victoria.  The one
enchants the imagination; the other relates itself
to the great social order of human life.  The latter
reveals the vast resources of British Columbia; the
almost infinite possibilities for the transcendent
future of a new and still higher civilisation; the
regions of the homes, the development, the nobler
and still nobler culture of life in its evolutionary
progress.
</p>

<p>
The comfort and beauty of these Grand Trunk
Pacific steamers are, as noted in the preceding
chapter, responsible for much of the enjoyment of
the voyage.  To be comfortable&mdash;even to have the
senses gratified with beauty in one's immediate
environment&mdash;is by no means the chief end or aim
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
of life, but it is assuredly a means to an end; after
that other things.  He who is
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Alive to gentle influence<br />
  Of landscape and of sky,<br />
  And tender to the spirit-touch,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
can hardly escape the immediate sense of a reinforcement
of energy by the subtle charm of a pleasing
environment.  It is like the influence of music,
harmonising and co-ordinating all one's powers of
achievement.
</p>

<p>
The coast of British Columbia, stretching away
to the southland, has its own order of beauty, as
has already been described in the description of the
voyage which begins at Seattle extending to Skagway.
The two days of return from Prince Rupert are only
too brief for the traveller with an eye for the singular
beauty of precipitous cliffs, forest-crowned, that
rise, from the shores, brilliantly diversified with the
waterfalls, islands, and glimpses of hanging glaciers,
now and then seen under radiant skies.
</p>

<p>
For tourists who, arriving at Prince Rupert, are
not able to make the Alaskan voyage, this sail to
Seattle will yet hold so much of majesty and beauty
that, while not fully compensating for the northern
cruise, is yet singularly satisfying in itself.  Leaving
Prince Rupert at nine in the morning the steamer
calls at Vancouver at four in the afternoon of the
next day; and hardly is she at her dock before the
enterprising municipal motor car company sends a
representative on board to announce a "one-dollar-an-hour-and-a-half"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
trip about the city in a number
of spacious motor cars in waiting, which offers to all
who embrace the opportunity the interest of seeing
the famous Stanley Park, covering a thousand acres,
together with the Shaughnessy Heights, the marine
drive, and all points of interest, with the sightseers
assured that they should be delivered at their
steamer in good time for its departure.
</p>

<p>
Vancouver's growth has been truly remarkable.
It began thirty years ago with a few log-cabins
in a clearing overlooking Burrard Inlet.  In 1901
the population of the city was about 27,000;
to-day, 200,000 people are citizens of Vancouver and
suburbs.  Its wharfs are crowded with shipping,
more than 18,000 vessels using the port in a single
year, while its customs revenue amounts to five
millions of dollars annually.
</p>

<p>
The business and residential sections of Vancouver
are extremely interesting and no tourist would
willingly miss seeing something of the largest
Canadian city on the Pacific Coast.  On the evening
of February 14, 1916, the first long-distance
telephone conversation was held between Vancouver and
Montreal.  Previous to this, telephonic communication
had been opened between New York and San
Francisco, a distance of 3400 miles; but on the
occasion of the opening between Montreal and
Vancouver the human voice was heard at a distance
of 4227 miles!
</p>

<p>
The marvellous progress made in telephone service
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
is illustrated by some records dating back more
than forty years.  It was in Boston in the spring of
1875 (March 10, 1875, to be exact), that Professor
Bell was first able to send an intelligible sentence
from one room to another in a building at No. 5,
Exeter Place, in that city.  This message to the next
room was to Thomas Augustus Watson, and
consisted of the words, "Mr. Watson, Mr. Watson, I
want you; come here."  In the summer of 1915,
Professor Bell sent the same message from New
York to Mr. Watson who was in San Francisco.

<p>
Miss Kate Field, the brilliant American critic
and lecturer, was among those fascinated by
Dr. Bell's initial experiments of 1875 demonstrating
his new invention.  Miss Field, while residing in
England, took an important part in bringing the
telephone to public notice.  In the biography of
Miss Field there appears a number of extracts from
her diary of this period, of which one, under the
date of January 14, 1878, runs as follows:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Drove early to Osborne Cottage (Isle of Wight) where
Sir Thomas Biddulph invited me to come in the evening.
Arrived there all fine in my new gown at 8.30 P.M.  Met
Lady Biddulph, Sir Thomas, General Ponsonby,
Mrs. Ponsonby, and others.  Very polite and very courteous
about telephone.  I sang Kathleen Mavourneen to the
Queen who was delighted and thanked me telephonically.
Sang Cuckoo Song, Comin' Thro' the Rye, and recited
Rosalind's epilogue.  All delighted.  Then I went to Osborne
House and met the Duke of Connaught.  Experiments a
great success."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So comprehensive were Miss Field's convictions of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
the wide scope and resistless nature of scientific
advance that she once remarked to a friend, "I look
to see science prove immortality."  Her faith in
immortality was not wanting, but she believed it
to be within that order of truth which might actually
be demonstrated by science.
</p>

<p>
Victoria is only some six hours' sail from
Vancouver&mdash;beautiful Victoria, worthy of the greatest
queen of the ages whose name the city so proudly
bears.  Not only for its signal attractions, but as
the capital of British Columbia, Victoria has especial
interest, and the tourist who is wise will disembark
and remain in this delightful city until the next
steamer arrives continuing the voyage to Seattle.
An English city dropped into the American continent
is Victoria.  It is neither Canadian nor yet of
the United States, but it is practically an English
city located on Vancouver Island.  It is already
an important port, and the equable climate attracts
residents and visitors from the entire continent.
</p>

<p>
It is called, indeed, "the city of sunshine," and it
has both wealth and health in measure to impress
the visitor, if it does not transform him into at least
a temporary resident.  The aristocratic residential
district has entrancing views of the sea, islands, bays,
and mountains, and more than three miles of coast
line.  The beauty of the architectural effects, the
equable climate, the delightful drives afforded by
the wide asphalt-paved boulevards, and the variety
of amusements and entertainments&mdash;yachting, golf,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
fishing, country clubs with all manner of sports and
games, together with its good schools, numerous
churches, and library, attract a population of
refinement and of a notable order of intellectuality.
</p>

<p>
To arrive at Seattle in the early dawn is to arrive
at the psychological moment.

counsels Sir Walter; and to view Seattle at her
most typical and representative moment one should
see her first in the golden glow of a morning, that
illuminates all her crescent harbour and reveals her
streets alive in the new energy of the day.  Seattle is
known as "the Seaport of Success."  She takes the
opposite pole from the motto Dante saw over the
red city of Dis.  Far from any abandonment of hope
by "those who enter here," the very spectacle of
her eager, intense life reinvigorates the newcomer.
Has he not entered the Seaport of Success?  "If you
want success&mdash;Succeed!" counsels Emerson.  Of
course one will succeed in Seattle.  That is what he
is there for.  He is "born for the job."  Seattle is the
marvel of the day.  One quite sympathises with the
citizen who met a press correspondent from New
York on a train and begged him to include Seattle
in his glowing interpretations.  "But I was in
Seattle last week," rejoined the writer.  "Oh, but
you should see Seattle <i>now!</i>" replied the up-to-date
resident.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
</p>

<p>
Seattle has a population of nearly three hundred
and fifty thousand; she has four transcontinental
railways; and fifty-seven steamship lines.  Lake
Washington, lying just outside the city, a sheet of
water twenty-five miles in length and averaging
three miles in width, offers one of the most ideal and
poetic regions for suburban homes, and one whose
privileges are apparently appreciated.  The beautiful
residences that adorn its shores render it a locality
well worth seeing.  The lake extends to the foothills
of the Cascade range, whose peaks, perpetually
covered with ice and snow, are from five thousand
to more than fourteen thousand feet in height.  With
this majestic mountain range on one hand, and
Puget Sound on the other, Seattle has an environment
that rivals, in natural beauty, any other city
of the world.  The boulevards of Seattle are famous,
and of these ex-President Taft declared that they
formed one of the most magnificent combinations of
modern city and mediæval forest.  From these
boulevards of thirty miles in extent, connecting a
chain of thirty-eight parks, there are continual vistas
of lake, and sea, and snow-capped mountains, and
the drive is often among arbours and flowers and
shrubs revealing rare skill and taste in gardening.
</p>

<p>
The State of Washington has wisely inaugurated
a system of splendid roadways, whose skilful
engineering has rendered the broad boulevards, the
country highways, a veritable paradise of comfort
to motorists.  More than fifty thousand miles of such
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
road thoroughfares stretch in all directions from
Seattle.  Four of these great highways, those of the
Pacific, Sunset, Olympic, and National Parks, were
built and are maintained at the expense of the state.
One important feature of these is the Pacific
Highway, a thoroughfare of 2000 miles in length,
connecting British Columbia with the southern
limit of California.  It is the longest drive of the world
and has a picturesque beauty unsurpassed by that
of any known region.
</p>

<p>
Nor are the ardent residents of Seattle in any way
inclined to reticence regarding her allurements.  To
one voyager on board, who was a native of the
States, but who had been so spellbound by her first
wonderful trip through Canada that she longed to
"assume a virtue, though she had it not" and
pass herself off as a native of the Dominion&mdash;to this
tourist a Seattle lady rather importunately insisted
that she ought to remain at least a week in the
"Seaport of Success" and revel in its amazements.
"You would see parks of hundreds of acres,"
exclaimed the loyal resident of the capital city of
the State of Washington, among other enumerations
of the glories to be revealed.  "Oh, is that all?"
unkindly responded the voyager.  "Why, in Canada
we are accustomed to parks of over four thousand
square miles."  The devotee of Canadian landscapes
endeavoured to say this with the air of one born and
bred in the Dominion, and she was quite charmed
with her evident success when the Seattle lady
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
replied, "Oh, you are a Canadian?  I thought you
were one of our own people."  "Did you, indeed?"
returned the masquerading Canadian, non-committantly,
with the most innocent and unconscious air
that it was possible to assume.

It is an interesting and picturesque trip by rail
from Seattle to Portland (some seven hours) and
from Portland out to its port, Flavell-Astoria, is
another picturesque little journey, some two hours
by rail.  Here awaits one of the Pacific steamers of
the Great Northern Company, with its top deck
glass-enclosed, making the vast sweep of ocean view
possible in all weather; with four other promenade
decks, with its ballroom, its conveniences for games
of all sorts, and its enormous crowds of gay passengers.
The sail from Flavell-Astoria to San Francisco is
only thirty-six hours; too brief for a lover of beauty,
yet a great deal of enjoyment can be crowded into
that time by those who surprise the secret.
</p>

<p>
It was not only the ideal way by which to approach
the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915, but it
remains the ideal way in which to approach San
Francisco.  The first instinctive thought of the
tourist is that he can only enjoy this approach if he
arrives from Hawaii, or Japan, or some port in the
Orient.  On the contrary, he can enjoy one of the
great and one of the most picturesque trips that the
resources of this world afford, by journeying to
California, via Prince Rupert, and on, by sea, by
land, by sea again, through Vancouver and Seattle;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
thence by way of Portland, and Flavell-Astoria, to
the triumphant entrance by the Golden Gate.  It was
a marvellous tour for the vanished Exposition
summer of 1915, and it will remain marvellous for
all the summers to come, growing as the years pass
more beautiful, more feasible, and more familiar
to the travelling public.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
CANADA IN THE PANAMA-PACIFIC EXPOSITION
</h3>

<p>
The year of 1915 will forever remain illuminated in
the history of Canada and of the United States as
that of the celebration of two momentous events:
the completion of the Panama-Pacific Canal, uniting
the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans; and the
bridging the entire continent, from Montreal to
Vancouver, from New York to San Francisco, by
human speech.  The achievement of the Panama
Canal was at a cost of three hundred and ten
millions of dollars; the achievement of "the voyage
of the voice" across the continent, by the Bell
telephone system, cost that company twice the
amount of the expenditure demanded by the canal.
During the next decade, the Bell Company propose
to expend an even greater sum in the perfecting
of all the future possibilities that may arise.
</p>

<p>
The completion of the Panama Canal is one of the
signal events in the world's history.  It changes the
great currents of commerce; it has reduced the
distance between the central points of the Atlantic
and the Pacific coasts from 13,000 to 5000 miles, and
it will greatly reduce the cost of coaling on voyages
from coast to coast.  From Colon, on the Atlantic
side of the Isthmus, to Balboa, on the Pacific side,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
was formerly, by the water route around Cape Horn,
a distance of 10,500 nautical miles; through the
canal the distance is 44 miles.  The time required
between these two points formerly approximated
to 126 days; now the distance between is but one
day.  These elementary statistics reveal to some
degree the inestimable value of the achievement
to all the nations of the world.
</p>

<p>
It was fitting that such an achievement should
be celebrated with an exposition of the arts, the
resources, the productions, and the inventions of
the civilised world.  It was the vivid drama of
international achievement.  There were more than
eighty thousand single exhibits, and groups of
related exhibits, representing every phase of the
highest efforts of man in contemporary progress.
Industries and economics, inventions and discoveries,
arts and sciences, education and ethics, met
under the striking architectural beauty and in a
scenic setting never before equalled in any land.
Against a background of the blue Pacific lying under
a glowing western sky, with a splendour of decoration
hardly paralleled, the scene was one worthy
to be forever perpetuated in the world's history.  It
struck the note of a new life.  The contrast between
this illustration of the development of the arts of
peace&mdash;the vision of the spirit that united East
and West in the common cause of all that ennobles
and exalts&mdash;and those awful scenes of carnage that
were raging in central Europe on the other side of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
the globe, was a contrast that might well employ
the genius of Thucydides to depict, with a pen
lighted from the living coal on the altar.  Yet, such
is the leading of divinely-guided destiny, each was
doing its work in the regeneration of the world.  The
seemingly irreparable calamity of the war was
sweeping away old conditions that the new life of
spiritualisation should enter in; it was the preparing
the way of the Lord and making His paths straight.
Faith constantly discerned the triumphant exhortation:
</p>

<p>
"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift
up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of Glory
shall come in!"
</p>

<p>
More than three hundred congresses met in these
palaces under the shadow of the Tower of Jewels;
in the halls of music, of art, or in the terraced
pavilion of the Court of the Universe.  All were
welcomed with that royal hospitality that has ever
characterised the generous heart of San Francisco.
These congresses dealt for the most part with the
vital topics of the day.  They concerned themselves
less with the life of literature and more with the life
of nature; less with the life that takes note of
abstract and profound intellectual problems and
more with the practical applications of ethical truth.
The congresses thus discussed open-air life, foods,
clothing, motoring, the political enfranchisement
of women, new theories in education, hygiene,
economics, charities.  In the building of Liberal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
Arts there was one exhibit from the Observatory
on Mount Lowe, labelled by the director of that
institution, as the stuff of which the universe and
man were made: that of electrons and mentoids.
The distinctively new note of the twentieth century
was everywhere in evidence.  The Exposition
planted its standard in an approaching Future, not
in a receding Past.  By this standard alone could
it be truly judged.  The salons of fine art did not
measurably offer, in any extent, the quality of art
displayed at Chicago in 1893, nor was it comparable
with that transcendently superb collection of
paintings and sculpture that concentrated the
inspiration of the centuries in the Paris Exposition of
1900.  Naturally, there were physical barriers of
space and the barriers of war conditions that
effectually determined this.  It was easy for Europe
and the Orient to send to Paris their most adequate
representation.  And France, alone, is so rich in her
national treasures of art, both of the past and of
contemporary work, that her own display alone
would have made a profound impression.  For San
Francisco, in 1915, conditions effectually debarred
her from securing much of the great art of the
world.  Very wisely, she did not dash herself blindly
and unavailingly against destiny, but wisely struck
the key of desire from a new centre.  The result was
in that the Exposition suggested its own ideals with
but slight reference to traditions.
</p>

<p>
Singularly fortunate was it, indeed, in its administration.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
President Charles C. Moore seemed the
man best fitted for the high and responsible place
that he so ably filled.  Never was a great
world-exposition conducted with a more remarkable
combination of wisdom, courtesy, admirable judgment,
and comprehensive treatment.  Not less fortunate
was the great undertaking in its vice-presidents:
William H. Crocker, R. B. Hale, I. W. Hellman,
jun., M. H. De Young, Leon Sloss, and James Bolph,
jun., while Dr. Frederick J. V. Skiff, as Director-in-Chief;
George Hough Perry, at the head of the
Publicity Department; and Mr. A. M. Mortesen, as
Traffic Manager, were all felicitously equipped for
their special service.
</p>

<p class="quote">
  "The Future is our kingdom,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
said George Sterling, the poet of the day, whose
poem entitled <i>The Builders</i> was read by George
Arlett, a member of the California State
Commission, at the closing ceremonies.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sterling struck the keynote of the splendid
enterprise in these stanzas:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "We do but cross a threshold into day.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty we leave behind<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deeper beauty on our path to find<br />
  And higher glories to illume the way.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door we close behind us is the Past;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sons shall find a fairer door at last.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A world reborn awaits us!  Years to come<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall know its grace and good,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wars shall end in endless brotherhood<br />
  And birds shall build in cannon long since dumb.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men shall have peace, though then no man may know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who built this sunset city long ago."<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
</p>

<p>
Only nine years had passed since San Francisco
had been practically destroyed by a sudden and
terrible calamity.  But the spirit of the Golden
Gate laughs at calamity and with a magician's wand
transmutes it into success.  Only two years after
this devastation San Francisco raised millions for
the exposition she had planned.  No earthquake
could entomb her spirit, nor could it be drowned by
any tidal wave that the Pacific is capable of
providing.  With that lofty poet, William Vaughan Moody,
who, alas, "died too soon" for the nation which
his lyre entranced, San Francisco might well
declare:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "From wounds and sore defeat<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made my battle-stay;<br />
  Winged sandals for my feet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wove of my delay."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Panama-Pacific Exposition opened on
February 15, 1915, and closed on December 4 of
the same year.  It was participated in by the
Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Dominican Republic,
Equador, France, Guatemala, Haiti, Holland, Honduras,
Italy, Japan, Liberia, Mexico, Nicaragua, New
Zealand, Panama, Persia, Peru, Portugal, Salvador,
Spain, Sweden, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
</p>

<p>
This enumeration of the countries participating
will of itself suggest the somewhat new class of
exhibits, as differing from those of older countries
in former world-displays.  The Panama-Pacific was
thus its own precedent.  Its claims to the novel and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
the unique were extremely well sustained.  It was
the second exposition held on the Pacific coast, and
it had the longest duration by four months of any
ever held before.
</p>

<p>
The grounds comprised over 600 acres, with a
water-front of two and a half miles, on San
Francisco Bay, just east of the Golden Gate.  On the
other three sides they were partly enclosed by hills,
thus forming a natural amphitheatre.  There were
eleven colossal palaces with many lesser buildings.
These palaces were grouped in a series of rectangles
connected by courts and arcades with an Andalusian
charm.  The courts fascinated the eye by their
colonnades, arches, domes, and glittering minarets.
They were adorned by mural paintings of symbolic
significance, by fountains, sunken gardens, and
sculptured art, with niches and restful seats.
Festival Hall, with its superb organ, where a
concert was held every day, contained an auditorium
seating three thousand people, and there were also
ten smaller halls.  The National Government staged
its own special exhibit on a ten-acre space,
appropriating two million dollars for this purpose, and
this exhibit included a representation of the
building of the Panama Canal.
</p>

<p>
In all this imposing world-panorama of twentieth-century
exhibits, Canada led the procession.  Whatever
the enthralling nature of spectacles offered
by other nations, it was the Dominion that set
the pace.  Canada, an entrancing, garlanded figure,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
aglow with her abounding enthusiasms; her resistless
energy; her dreams of a future that crystallise
themselves in her all-conquering empire
building&mdash;Canada the Spellbinder assumed her place as
if by divine right, and certainly by common consent,
as the very Winged Victory flying on into a
golden future.  The Canadian Building, whose
classic beauty would have done no discredit to the
Parthenon had it also occupied a place on the
"Holy Hill" that overlooks all Attica; this structure,
so simple yet so rich in architectural effect, her
main portal guarded by great lions sculptured on
either side, was one of the most impressive creations
of the entire Exposition.  With a singular
comprehensiveness of grouping, the exhibits in this
building represented the Dominion in her completeness.
It was no one province that engaged the attention
to the exclusion of another; it was the Dominion
herself, in the unity of her vast empire, rather than
any merely tributary feature of the country.  In
the inscrutable magic that wrought this effect lay
the secret of its spellbinding quality.  It was a
power that enthralled every visitor who crossed the
threshold, and brought him back to study it again.
</p>

<p>
How was this result achieved?  The question was
in the air.  Every one asked it.  No one could exactly
answer it, but every one shared the wonder.  The
statistical data of the Dominion was impressive
enough for almost any commensurate influence; yet
mere facts and figures could give little clue to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
mysterious effect on the throngs of visitors.  One
might read that the population of Canada had
increased from five millions to seven millions in ten
years; and that fifty-five per cent. of this
population was engaged in conquering Nature, and
transmuting her plains into golden harvests as a granary
of the world; that her Government is expending
ten millions a year in agricultural instruction alone;
that her root and fodder crop each year is valued
at almost two hundred millions of dollars, representing
an area of nine million acres, and that the value
of her field crops annually is five hundred and fifty
millions of dollars.  One might read that her live
stock, valued at a given time at seven hundred
millions, increased a hundred and fifty per
cent. within one decade only.  This visitor might recall
the shrewd assertion of James J. Hill that "there
is land enough in Canada, if thoroughly tilled, to
feed every person in Europe"; and that, while at
present only thirty-six million acres are under
cultivation, there are four hundred and forty
millions, thirty per cent. of her entire area, that are
available for agricultural use.  Yet not all these
impressive statistics can alone account for the innate
magic, the indescribable witchery, that Canada
flings about all who come to look upon these
marvellous panoramas in her building.  Statistical data
have their uses and inspire respect, while one cons
them by heart and feels sure he is thereby equipped
to give a reason for the faith that is in him; but in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
his heart he knows that all the figures in the realm
of mathematics could not really account for his
consciousness of the fascinations of the Dominion.
A leading journal of San Francisco, advocating the
desire that the Californian exhibit should be made
a permanent one, proceeded to point the moral and
adorn the tale by pointing to the Canadian
exhibition.  The editorial argument thus ran:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Canada, with her complete exhibit, has won much
praise from Exposition sightseers and has set the precedent
for a permanent exhibit.  One reason why our northern
neighbour was able to make such a splendid impression
at the Jewel City from the first was because, as its display
was permanent, much of it had been installed in a European
exhibition and had come directly here from across the
Atlantic.  The packing cases were ready to be opened and
the best arrangement for the resources of Canada had been
determined by experience.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"California needs to be an active participant in future
expositions, as active as the Dominion of Canada.
</p>

<p class="quote">
* * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p class="quote">
"With a permanent exhibit California will be ready at
the first sound of an exposition reveille to rush to the front,
full panoplied in luscious armour of golden butter, armed
with 42-cm. cases of preserved fruits and with glittering
shields of virgin gold.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Then bring on your Canada!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The skill with which the Canadian exhibit was
grouped impressed itself first as a work of art, and
only secondarily as a thing of commercial value.
This skill in presentation was not the least element
in its attractiveness.  Here was Dawson, shooting
out rays of violet, vermilion, and orange, myriads of
lights in all the colours of the spectrum.  A panoramic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
view of a wheat belt that would feed the world;
Vancouver, with the great elevator at the water's
edge; and with that, was Vancouver's prophetic
dream of 1923, when three hundred millions of
bushels of grain will be sent from Canada to Europe
by the way of the Panama Canal; again there were
the homes of farmers, attractive and realistic; an
orchard scene introducing real fruit, and where
realism ended and art began it was difficult to
discover; the trees were laden with fruit; apples lay in
heaps under the shade of the trees; young men and
maidens were gathering the rosy and the golden fruit,
tripping over the green turf so naturally that one
half wondered if they as well as the apples were not
actual?  Here was a section out of British Columbia
showing a sportsman's happy hunting-ground; there
were snow-capped mountains, but with real water
trickling down; an eagle, fierce, tempestuous, with
widespread, flapping wings, is hovering in the air in
a manner that would do credit to Heller, the wizard
of necromancy on the stage.  From yawning crevices
bears emerge, until the visitor instinctively shrinks
away, and the beaver is seen constructing his dam.
Was it Governor Frontenac who recommended to
the King of France that the beaver should be
adopted as Canada's trade mark?
</p>

<p>
There are mounted duck, grouse, elk, buffalo,
and sullen, scowling carabou gazing at the
surging throng.  There are buffalo from the Peace
River region, a thousand miles north of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
border between Canada and the States, where these
hordes formerly ranged in countless droves, and
which to-day is one of the finest of wheat-growing
regions.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is more interesting to the curious visitor
than are the views of typical Canadian homes.  Some
that are shown are but the growth of twelve years;
from the time of the first turning of the plough in
the prairie soil to completion of the two-storied,
balconied house, with its broad piazza, set in the
pretty grounds whose shady trees were planted as
seedlings, with gay parterres of flowers in and around
the curving walks and paths.  The facilities for thus
acquiring a home, by taking up the usual allotment
of a hundred and sixty acres of land, which can be
done on such favourable terms, turned the attention
of many visitors toward the Dominion.
</p>

<p>
Another exhibit of great interest was that of
power plant models, for every industrial centre in
Canada has this abundance of power at very low
rates, owing to the enormous supply of water power
in the country.  The canneries, too, form one of the
most important industries, and their extent is well
illustrated in the display made in the Canadian
building.
</p>

<p>
There are cases upon cases of specimens of Canada's
precious minerals: gold from British Columbia,
silver ore from Cobalt, gold from the Yukon, and
copper and various other minerals, with representative
specimens of coal deposits.  Other glass cases
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
again display much of the flora of Canada, in a
profusion of flowers whose rich and brilliant colouring
attracts attention; and there are curious grasses
and rare plants and foliage.
</p>

<p>
In one corridor are a group of life-like portraits in
oil of King George and Queen Mary, of several of
the Governors-General of the Dominion, and of many
of the Government officials, Sir John A. Macdonald,
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and Premier Borden.  In this
connection it is rather interesting to recall that the
appellation of the term Dominion to the country was
due to a member of Parliament who, after Sir John
Macdonald had arranged for the confederation of
the nine provinces, and a name was being discussed,
said that he had that morning read in his Bible the
words: "His Dominion shall be from sea to sea,"
and the happy augury was seized and the term
applied to the vast and splendid country.
</p>

<p>
Colonel William Hutchinson's hospitable offices
were a favourite rendezvous for appreciative visitors.
Here gathered Canadians and Canada-lovers to
discuss the latest news from the Dominion.  So
largely, however, had Colonel Hutchinson's life
been passed in the noted national and international
expositions of the world that for fifteen years he
has hardly been more than three months at a time
in his home in Ottawa.
</p>

<p>
The Grand Trunk building offered, daily, a
moving picture exhibition that attracted many
onlookers, and so real were the effects that when in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
one a torrent of water came rushing over a cataract,
the visitor near involuntarily turned for a seat
farther back.  In this building, as in the national one,
the Dominion was laid under tribute in representation
that interpreted the essential life of Canada.
</p>

<p>
The superb collection of photographs of the
scenic mountain route of the Grand Trunk Pacific
was a perennial attraction to visitors in the exhibit
made by this transcontinental railway.  It revealed
anew how the completion of the Grand Trunk
System is an achievement which in its daring, its
magnitude of interests, and the enterprise involved
was one of the great twentieth-century events, and
one only to be compared with the opening of the
Panama-Pacific Canal itself.

The Reverend Arthur Barry O'Neill, C.S.G.,
after visiting the Exposition, wrote that he
considered the Canadian and the Grand Trunk buildings
as instances of "artistic genius beyond all praise,"
and as a "lasting honour and credit to the Canadian
Government."  In a sonnet in which Mr. O'Neill
celebrates the youth of Canada, the brave lads who
have gone to the front, and who
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "... have writ a score<br />
  Of valour true, surpassing old romance.<br />
  And lent new pride to each Canadian's glance,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the poet adds:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And here, as well, where contests fair of Peace,<br />
  The nations wage along the Golden Gate,<br />
  Huge throngs acclaim the Maple Leaf, nor cease<br />
  The chorused praise that makes our hearts elate."<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is not the aim in this chapter to describe the
whole of this interesting and beautiful Exposition,
but only the contribution made by Canada; yet
one can hardly refrain from noting the charm of the
Alaskan exhibit with its panoramic presentation of
the Muir glacier; nor that of the Santa Fe Railway
in the "Zone," where the very realistic and
wonderful portrayal of the Grand Canyon in Arizona was
one of the great attractions of the entire grounds.
</p>

<p>
The Palace of Transportation was one of the
extremely interesting features of the Exposition.
Here could be studied the latest scientific methods
of the day in many details not familiar to the general
public, as, for instance, the method of handling mails
on fast trains and the delivery at stations while the
full speed of the train is maintained; many types of
marine transportation; and still more of aircraft,
the navigation of the air being one of the things
constantly demonstrated to throngs of people who
were absorbingly interested in the possibilities of
aerial flight.
</p>

<p>
The experimental panorama of the Panama
Canal itself was an appropriate feature.  At the
Exposition in Paris in 1900 the journey on the
Trans-Siberian Railway was produced with extraordinary
realism.  The traveller entered a luxurious
train, a very real train comprising drawing-room
and dining cars, as well as a library car, and the
passing of the long panorama of the entire scenery
of that noted route gave a very vivid idea of what one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
would see in the actual journey.  The California
Exposition arranged a similar exhibit of a journey
through the Panama Canal.  The voyager was
invited to the deck of a steamer, and ingenious
illusions illustrated the sailing from ocean to ocean.
</p>

<p>
San Francisco was a gala city through the entire
summer.  Not the least of the enjoyments were the
sails in the splendid local boats, with glass-enclosed
decks, across the Bay to Oakland and to Berkeley,
the latter city the seat of the University of California.
There were excursions for every day in the week for
those who wished to vary the scene, and the Exposition
itself constantly presented new attractions and
new features with the great number of congresses,
the numerous lectures, and perpetual fêtes.
</p>

<p>
The close of the Panama-Pacific Exposition was
a scene worthy to live in historic pageantry.  The
day was one of June dropped into the heart of
December.  The sun was burning against a cloudless
sapphire sky.  Within the very radiance of the Tower
of Jewels, on one of the terraces of the Court of
the Universe, was erected a stand on which were
assembled the Directors, the Commissioners of
Foreign Governments, the representatives of the
Army and Navy of California, and the representatives
of the City of San Francisco.  From the arches
of the Rising and the Setting Sun the sculptured
figures looked down.  There was orchestral music,
and the reading of Mr. Sterling's poem from which
lines have been quoted in preceding pages.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
message of Woodrow Wilson, President of the
United States, was flashed around the world at the
moment it was given to the Exposition.  President
Wilson well expressed the significance of the
undertaking as one "eloquent of the new spirit which is
to unite East and West and make all the world
partners in the common enterprises of progress and
humanity."
</p>

<p>
The guards marched away; the sailors fired a
salute; the Exposition banner descended.  President
Moore's pictorial words have immortalised the scene:
</p>

<p>
"Night came on, and the world's wonder of lights;
the Exposition lights that would never shine again&mdash;a
red glow on Kelham's towers, rose flame in the
porches of the Machinery Palace, dim reflections
in the Lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts and the
broad basin in the Court of the Four Seasons, the
splendour of the giant monstrances in the Court
of Abundance, the silver phosphorescence of the
Adventurous Bowman on his column and the Lord
of the Isthmian Way on his rack-o'-bones horse,
the tremulous frosty shimmer of the hundred
thousand jewels of the great spire; and over all,
the long bands, like lambent metal, of bronze and
crimson and green and blue, from the forty-eight
searchlights on the Yacht Harbour Mole, bands that
barred the heavens so far that they deceived the eye
and in the south-east appeared to converge beyond
the hills of the city.
</p>

<p>
"Not abruptly, but slowly and gently, the lamps
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
grew dark, the beams of the searchlights faded, and
arches and courts and colonnades and towers and
sculptured forms of men and women and angels
and great beasts receded into the friendly night,
lighted now by the glimmer of the winter stars,
Orion and Sirius, Aldebaran and the Hyades.  And
through the starlight 'Taps' dropped in liquid
notes from bugles high on the Tower of Jewels."

CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
CANADIAN POETS AND POETRY
</h3>

<p class="intropoem">
  "My guide is but the stir to song."<br />
</p>

<p class="intropoem">
  "But Love must kiss that mortal's eyes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hopes to see fair Arcady;<br />
  No gold can buy you entrance there,&mdash;<br />
  No wisdom won with weariness."<br />
</p>

<p class="intropoem">
  "''Tis strange you cannot sing,' quoth he,<br />
  'The folk all sing in Arcady.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Arcady, or Canada, are they one and the same?
The pipes of Pan echo throughout the entire
Dominion.  The Poet&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Born and nourished in miracles,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
writes his scroll by every shining lake, in the deep,
dim interior of the forest, on every majestic
mountain height.  He renders constant service to the
inward law, and it is the poet who is the real
historian of his country.  It is he who immortalises her
heroic deeds; who paints her landscapes in unfading
colours; who crystallises her greatness into song.
One line of the poet's may outweigh a volume of
descriptive prose.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "His instant thought a Poet spoke<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the age his fame."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It would be a marvel if the Canadian colour and
atmosphere did not produce a choir of singers, if not,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
indeed, a nation of poets.  Nor can national poetic
feeling be measurably restricted to the comparatively
few greater poets in any land or literature; to the
supreme masters in the lyric art.  The greatness of
Wordsworth, Landor, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, of
the Brownings, Tennyson, and of Swinburne, does not
detract from, even though it overshadows, the charm
of a score of the lesser poets, each of whom has his
individual place.  Had the lives of Browning and
Tennyson been of the comparatively brief duration
of Stephen Phillips, how much of their noblest work
would have been unwritten?  Had not Wilfrid and
Alice Meynell, with angelic goodness, rescued Francis
Thompson from destitution, what might not the
world of poetic literature have missed?  It is not
alone by the standard of Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe,
or Petrarca that the art of poetry should be estimated.
To no inconsiderable degree the number as well as
the quality of the poets of a nation are typical of the
national inspiration.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Canada, as a country that looks
back to hardly more than a century and a half of
organised life and whose literary expression has
been almost entirely within the past half century,
should have produced a body of poetry that has just
claims to being considered national literature is as
impressive as it is interesting.
</p>

<p>
"Has Canada a voice of her own in literature
distinct from that of England?" questions Thomas
Guthrie Marquis.  "In Poetry, at least," he adds,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
"the Canadian note is clear and distinct, and of
permanent value."  There was little Canadian verse
produced until well within the nineteenth century;
and the first poem of real claim to distinction was
the "Saul" of Charles Heavysege, published in 1857,
a poem written "in the grand manner," the author
presenting his ideas "with a dignity, austerity, and
epic grandeur that are found in few poetic
compositions."  It was, however, with the decade of 1880-90
that the era of the modern and artistic poetic
literature of Canada really opened, its keynote sounded
by a poet, then hardly twenty years of age&mdash;Charles
George Douglas Roberts&mdash;whose name has come to
be widely known as that of one whose lips have been
touched with the divine fire.  His initial volume,
<i>Orion and Other Poems</i>, revealed something in the
quality that established his right to poetic rank.
His very crudities, faults of construction inevitable
to youthful ardour and inexperience, were still more
suggestive of promise than higher technical
excellence that might be recognised among contemporary
verse.  The classical tendency and temperamental
assimilation were very obvious; the young man was
evidently a devotee of Shelley and Tennyson; but he
might easily have had worse masters.  Six years later
came his second volume of verse, <i>In Divers Tones</i>,
that at once laid special claim on lovers of poetry;
and when, in 1893, his <i>Songs of the Common Day</i>
appeared, with its exquisite <i>Ave</i>, commemorating
the centenary of Shelley, many people felt that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
a new star had arisen to shine with permanent
splendour in the poetic firmament.  There are lines
and stanzas in the <i>Ave</i> that are worthy to hold
their immortality so long as the art of poetry lives
to bless and ennoble and inspire life.  Shelley&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the breathless child of change,<br />
  Urged ever by the soul's divine unrest."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And again:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But all about the tumult of his heart<br />
  Stretched the great calm of his celestial art."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And this stanza:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thyself the lark melodious in mid-heaven;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thyself the Protean shape of chainless cloud.<br />
  Pregnant with elemental fire, and driven<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through deeps of quivering light, and darkness loud<br />
  With tempest, yet beneficent as prayer.  "<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And the breathing line:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And speechless ecstasy of growing June,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
condensing in itself all the rapture of summer hours;
or the beautiful stanza:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O heart of fire, that fire might not consume!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever glad the world because of thee;<br />
  Because of thee forever eyes illume<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more enchanted earth, a lovelier sea!<br />
  O poignant voice of the desire of life,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piercing our lethargy, because thy call<br />
  Aroused our spirits to a nobler strife<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where base and sordid fall,<br />
  Forever past the conflict and the pain<br />
  More clearly beams the goal we shall attain!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Perhaps the most perfect lyric of Charles G. D. Roberts,
and one that, while in no sense an imitation,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
yet suggests the <i>Break, Break, Break</i> of Tennyson,
is that entitled <i>Grey Rocks and Greyer Sea</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Grey rocks, and greyer sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surf along the shore&mdash;<br />
  And in my heart a name<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lips shall speak no more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The high and lonely hills<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endure the darkening year&mdash;<br />
  And in my heart endure<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A memory and a tear.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Across the tide a sail<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tosses, and is gone&mdash;<br />
  And in my heart the kiss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That longing dreams upon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Grey rocks, and greyer sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And surf along the shore&mdash;<br />
  And in my heart the face<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I shall see no more."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One of the stirring poems is that of <i>An Ode for the
Canadian Confederacy</i>, in which occur the lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Awake, my country, the hour of dreams is done!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt not, nor dread the greatness of thy fate."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The lyre of Charles G. D. Roberts is one of many
strings, and the temptation is rather irresistible to
quote from him at still greater length.
</p>

<p>
Within the opening years of the decade of 1860-70
were born Charles G. D. Roberts, William Wilfred
Campbell, Archibald Lampman, Bliss Carman,
George Frederick Scott (now Canon Scott), and
another who, though bearing the same name, is only
related to the Reverend Canon by the ties of poetic
brotherhood, Duncan Campbell Scott.  William
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
Henry Drummond (known especially as "The
Poet of the Habitant") and Isabella Valancy Crawford
belonged to the preceding decade, and although
ranked as Canadian poets, were born in Ireland,
coming to the Dominion at an early age.
</p>

<p>
William Wilfred Campbell is the poet both of
Nature and of human interests.  No adequate view of
an art so many-veined and so fine as his can be
presented within the limited space of these pages,
but from his noble poem on <i>England</i> this stanza
is taken:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And if ever the smoke of an alien gun<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should threaten her iron repose,<br />
  Shoulder to shoulder against the world.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face to face with her foes,<br />
  Scot and Celt and Saxon are one<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Glory of England goes."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And this from <i>The Hills and the Sea</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Give me the uplands of purple,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweep of the vast world's rim,<br />
  Where the sun dips down, or the dawnings<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the earth's edge swim,<br />
  With the days that are dead and the old earth-tales,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human, and haunting, and grim."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A discerning critic says of Mr. Campbell that his
poems are "something akin to the whisper of silence,
the magic of moonlight, the sadness of art."  Yet
perhaps more than all one finds the tender human
strain, as in <i>The Last Prayer</i>, of which these stanzas
are representative:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Master of life, the day is done;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sun of life is sinking low;<br />
  I watch the hours slip one by one<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hark the night-wind and the snow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And must thou banish all the hope,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large horizon's eagle-swim,<br />
  The splendour of the far-off slope<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ran about the world's great rim,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That rose with morning's crimson rays<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grew to noonday's gloried dome,<br />
  Melting to even's purple haze<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the hopes of earth went home?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yea, thou mayst quench the latest spark<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life's weird day's expectancy,<br />
  Roll down the thunders of the dark<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close the light of life for me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Melt all the splendid blue above<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let these magic wonders die,<br />
  If thou wilt only leave me, Love,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love's heart-brother, Memory."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
His <i>Canadian Folk Song</i> has become a popular
favourite.  The last stanza runs:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The firelight dances upon the wall,<br />
  Footsteps are heard in the outer hall,<br />
  And a kiss and a welcome that fill the room,<br />
  And the kettle sings in the glimmer and gloom&mdash;<br />
  Margery, Margery, make the tea,<br />
  Singeth the kettle merrily."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is in the setting of Canada's wonderland to
music that much of the best work of Mr. Campbell
lies; in his <i>Manitou</i>, <i>The Legend of Restless River</i>,
<i>Dawn in the Island Camp</i>, and the musical <i>Vapour
and Blue</i>.  He has made himself the interpreter of
Nature in all her moods, as has also Archibald
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
Lampman, of whom William Dean Howells said that
his pure spirit was electrical in every line; and that
"the stir of wing, of leaf, of foot; the drifting odours
of wood and field," thrilled his readers in his verse.
</p>

Canoeing on the Fraser River
</p>

<p>
In his <i>Passing of Autumn</i> Mr. Lampman gives
this delicate picture:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The wizard has woven his ancient scheme&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day and a star-lit night;<br />
  And the world is a shadowy-pencilled dream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of colour, and haze, and light."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And who would not turn to his <i>April in the Hills</i>
to greet the springtime?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I break the spirit's cloudy bands,<br />
  A wanderer in enchanted lands,<br />
  I feel the sun upon my hands;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far from care and strife<br />
  The broad earth bids me forth.  I rise<br />
  With lifted brow and upward eyes.<br />
  I bathe my spirit in blue skies,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taste the springs of life.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I feel the tumult of new birth;<br />
  I waken with the wakening earth;<br />
  I match the bluebird in her mirth;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild with wind and sun,<br />
  A treasurer of immortal days,<br />
  I roam the glorious world with praise,<br />
  The hillsides and the woodland ways,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till earth and I are one."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Lampman was a master of the sonnet and
one of these entitled <i>Outlook</i> touches a high note,
while another, <i>The Railway Station</i>, so interprets
the poetic side of common experiences as to be
rather distinctive among all his work and so claims
reproduction here:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P253"></a>253}</span>
</p>

<p>
  "The darkness brings no quiet here, the light<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No waking; ever on my blinded brain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flare of lights, the rush, the cry, and strain,<br />
  The engines' scream, the hiss and thunder smite:<br />
  I see the hurrying crowds, the clasp, the flight.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faces that touch, eyes that are dim with pain:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the hoarse wheels turn, and the great train<br />
  Move labouring out into the bourneless night.<br />
  So many souls within its deep recesses,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many bright, so many mournful eyes:<br />
  Mine eyes that watch grow fixed with dreams and guesses;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What threads of life, what hidden histories,<br />
  What sweet or passionate dreams and dark distresses,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What unknown thoughts, what various agonies!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Bliss Carman has long been recognised by the
critical lover of poetic art as a poet of unusual
distinction and grace.  When, in the days of his early
youth, his poem <i>Low Tide on Grand-Pré</i> appeared
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, all connoisseurs in
poet-lore felt the magical touch.  Over all the barren
reaches on which the sun had gone down the poet
saw the "unelusive glories":
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Was it a year or lives ago<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took the grasses in our hands.<br />
  And caught the summer flying low<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the waving meadow lands,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And held it there between our hands?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And that we took into our hands&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit of life, or subtler thing&mdash;<br />
  Breathed on us there, and loosed the bands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death, and taught us, whispering,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of some wonder thing."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That the poem is faintly, vaguely reminiscent of
Swinburne's <i>Félise</i> is only an added charm.  Like
a refrain of music lingers the last stanza:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The night has fallen, and the tide ...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now and again comes drifting home,<br />
  Across these aching barrens wide,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sigh like driven wind or foam:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grief the flood is bursting home!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Carman has kept faith with the poetic dreams
of his youth.  Could there be found in the songs of
any land a lyric more subtle, more delicately
exquisite in expression, than this which he calls <i>The
Unreturning</i>?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The old, eternal spring once more<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes back the sad, eternal way;<br />
  With tender, rosy light, before<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The going out of day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The great white moon across my door<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow in the twilight stirs;<br />
  But now, forever, comes no more<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wondrous look of Hers!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Master of many and varied orders of song,
Mr. Carman has the rare art of the ballad; and his
blank verse, as his lyrical, is enticing.  A series of
the daintiest lyrics, <i>Songs of the Sea Children</i>, call
up a very fairyland in which to wander.  One of
these (the lyrics form a sequence) thus portrays
the mysteries of spring:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In the blue mystery of the April woods,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy spirit now<br />
  Makes musical the rainbow's interludes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pink the peach-tree bough.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In the new birth of all things bright and fair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis only thou<br />
  Art very April, glory, light, and air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy and ardour now."<br />

Bliss Carman is a word-painter as well as a poet
in his lyrical work.  With what fairy-like magic
he pictures the landscape, the colouring, the very
breath of the summer wind, the rustle of leaves,
and the swaying of the flower on its stem.
</p>

<p>
From a multitude of examples, here is one poem,
entitled <i>The Dance of the Sunbeam</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When morning is high o'er the hilltops.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On river and stream and lake.<br />
  Whenever a young breeze whispers,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun-clad dancers wake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "One after one upspringing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They flash from their dim retreat,<br />
  Merry as running laughter<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the news of their twinkling feet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Over the floors of azure<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the wind flaws run,<br />
  Sparkling, leaping, and racing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their antics scatter the sun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As long as water ripples<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weather is clear and glad,<br />
  Day after day they are dancing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a moment sad.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But when through the field of heaven,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of storm take flight,<br />
  At a touch of the flying shadows<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They falter and slip from sight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Until, at the grey day's ending,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the squadrons of cloud retire,<br />
  They pass in the triumph of sunset<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With banners of crimson fire."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Carman is pre-eminently the poet of nature,
as how else could he be when, in <i>The Breath of the
Reed</i>, he makes this appeal?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Make me thy priest, O mother.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prophet of thy mood,<br />
  With all the forest wonder<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enraptured and imbued";<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
or when he thus expresses himself in <i>The Great
Return</i>?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When I have lifted up my heart to thee,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then hast thou ever hearkened and drawn near,<br />
  And bowed thy shining face close over me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I could hear thee as the hill-flowers hear.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When I have cried to thee in lonely need,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being but a child of thine bereft and wrung,<br />
  Then all the rivers in the hills gave heed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great hill winds in thy holy tongue&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That ancient incommunicable speech<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The April stars and Autumn sunsets know&mdash;<br />
  Soothed me and calmed me with solace beyond reach<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of human ken, mysterious and low."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Carman is, however, more than a writer of
exquisite lyrics, more even than a painter and
hymner of nature in its various aspects and moods.
He is more deeply concerned with the mystery which
we call life than with anything else, and again and
again seeks to understand and express his sense of
that mystery.  His <i>Behind the Arras</i>&mdash;described by
a recent writer as the most distinctive book of poems
issued in English in the past quarter of a century&mdash;
is a record of such attempts.  We quote here the
opening verse of <i>The Players</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "We are the players of a play<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As old as earth,<br />
  Between the wings of night and day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tears and mirth."<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And here the first verse of <i>In the Wings</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The play is life; and this round earth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow stage whereon<br />
  We act before an audience<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of actors dead and gone."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And here are some lines from <i>Beyond the Gamut</i>,
which for philosophic insight are surely hard to
equal in modern poetry:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As all sight is but a finer hearing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all colour but a finer sound,<br />
  Beauty, but the reach of lyric freedom,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caught and quivering past all music's bound;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Life, that faint sigh whispered from oblivion,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harks and wonders if we may not be<br />
  Five small wits to carry one great rhythmus,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast theme of God's new symphony.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "As fine sand spread on a disc of silver,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some chord which bids the notes combine,<br />
  Heeding the hidden and reverberant impulse,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifts and dances into curve and line,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The round earth, too, haply, like a dust-mote,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was set whirling her assigned sure way,<br />
  Round this little orb of her ecliptic<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some harmony she must obey."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The temptation to go on quoting from Mr. Carman's
work (which is more varied and touches more
chords than most persons&mdash;even among those who
endeavour to keep in touch with the poetry produced
in our day&mdash;are aware) has to be resisted, but space
must be found for a portion of a recent poem, <i>A
Mountain Gateway</i>, in which, in beauty and clarity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
of thought and expression, the poet reaches perhaps
his highest point:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I know a vale where I would go one day,<br />
  When June comes back and all the world once more<br />
  Is glad with summer.  Deep with shade it lies,<br />
  A mighty cleft in the green bosoming hills,<br />
  A cool dim gateway to the mountains' heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "On either side the wooded slopes come down,<br />
  Hemlock and beech and chestnut.  Here and there<br />
  Through the deep forest laurel spreads and gleams,<br />
  Pink-white as Daphne in her loveliness&mdash;<br />
  That still perfection from the world withdrawn,<br />
  As if the wood gods had arrested there<br />
  Immortal beauty in her breathless flight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And where the road runs in the valley's foot,<br />
  Through the dark woods a mountain stream comes down,<br />
  Singing and dancing all its youth away<br />
  Among the boulders and the shallow runs,<br />
  Where sunbeams pierce and mossy tree trunks hang<br />
  Drenched all day long with murmuring sound and spray.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There, light of heart and foot-free, I would go<br />
  Up to my home among the lasting hills,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And in my cabin doorway sit me down.<br />
  Companioned in that leafy solitude<br />
  By the wood ghosts of twilight and of peace,<br />
  While evening passes to absolve the day<br />
  And leave the tranquil mountains to the stars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And in that sweet seclusion I should hear,<br />
  Among the cool-leafed beeches in the dusk,<br />
  The calm-voiced thrushes at their evening hymn,<br />
  So undistraught, so rapturous, so pure,<br />
  It well might be, in wisdom and in joy,<br />
  The seraphs singing at the birth of time<br />
  The unworn ritual of eternal things."<br />
</p>

In the Reverend George Frederic Scott, D.C.L.,
F.R.S.C., Canon of the Cathedral in Quebec since
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
1894, Canada has a poet of high poetic seriousness
of especial distinction, and with just claims to more
than a national recognition.  A long poem entitled
<i>Evolution</i>, written by Canon Scott in 1887, stands
as something unique in English-speaking poetry,
in its presenting a great scientific truth with poetic
expression.  Of this some stanzas follow:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Life out of death, death out of life,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In endless cycles rolling on,<br />
  And fire-gleams flashing from the strife<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what will come and what has gone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But what art thou and what am I?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What place is ours in all this scheme?<br />

<p class="poem">
  "And we are present, future, past&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
  "That may be so; but to mine eyes<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thou canst not unmake what has been,<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But on we pass, for ever on,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through death to other deaths and life;<br />
  To brighter lights when these are gone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To broader thought, more glorious strife,<br />

<p class="poem">

<p>
In Canon Scott's <i>Requiescat</i>, in memory of General
Gordon, is one of the thrilling lyrics of memorial
verse:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O thou twice hero,&mdash;hero in thy life<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in thy death!&mdash;we have no power to crown<br />
  Thy nobleness; we weep thine arm in strife;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We weep, but glory in thy life laid down.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Saint! hero! through the clouds of doubt that loom<br />
  O'er darkling skies, thy life hath power to bless;<br />
  We thank thee thou hast shown us in the gloom<br />
  Once more Christ's power and childlike manliness."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A quatrain on Darwin's tomb in Westminster
Abbey is worthy to be held in memory:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The Muse, when asked what words alone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were worthy tribute to his fame,<br />
  Took up her pen, and on the stone<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inscribed his name."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Full of tender and beautiful feeling is this little
lyric of Canon Scott's that he entitles <i>Beyond</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My heart it lies beyond, dear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the setting day,<br />
  Where the whispers are soft and fond, dear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the voices that pass away;<br />
  And oft, when the night is falling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a calm is on the sea,<br />
  I fancy I hear them calling<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that far-off land for me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "It is only idle dreaming<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dream is full of rest.<br />
  And up where that glory is streaming<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gates of the golden west,<br />
  I wander away in spirit,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a mingled joy and pain,<br />
  Till I almost seem to inherit<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet dead past again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Yes, my heart it lies beyond, dear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where that sun is burning low,<br />
  And were you not so fond, dear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might perhaps&mdash;but no!<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
  Are you weary already with walking?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears!  What tears, dear, too!<br />
  How selfish of me to be talking,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My darling, in this way to you!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One of the most widely known and frequently
quoted of the poems of Canon Scott is the <i>Van
Elsen</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God spake three times and saved Van Elsen's soul:<br />
  He spake by illness first, and made him whole;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Elsen heard Him not,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or soon forgot.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God spake to him by wealth; the world outpoured<br />
  Its treasures at his feet, and called him lord;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Elsen's heart grew fat<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And proud thereat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "God spake the third time when the great world smiled,<br />
  And in the sunshine slew his little child;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Elsen like a tree<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell hopelessly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then in the darkness came a Voice which said:<br />
  'As thy heart bleedeth, so My heart hath bled;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have need of thee<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou needest Me.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That night Van Elsen kissed the baby feet,<br />
  And kneeling by the narrow winding-sheet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praised Him with fervent breath<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who conquered death."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

Canon Scott, who may well be recognised as
the most spiritual of Canadian poets, has published
five volumes of poems, <i>The Soul's Quest</i>, <i>My Lattice
and Other Poems</i>, <i>The Unnamed Lake</i>, <i>Poems Old and
New</i>, and <i>In the Battle Silences, Poems Written at
the Front</i>.  There is a depth of thought, an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
appealing grace and tenderness of feeling in his work that
insures his poems a treasured place in Canadian life.
</p>

<p>
Duncan Campbell Scott has the fascination of
the spontaneous singer, and how all the entrancement
of the Dominion is caught into these lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, Land of the dusky balsam,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the darling maple-tree,<br />
  Where the cedar buds and berries,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pine grows strong and free!<br />
  My heart is weary and weary<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own country."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Something in this song recalls, like remembered
music, Katherine Tynan's (Mrs. Hinkson) haunting
poem, <i>Homesick</i>, of which two lines run:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But my heart flies back to an Abbey gray<br />
  Where the dead sleep sweet, and the living pray."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The professional critic could find many poems of
Mr. Scott's with intrinsically greater claim than
this lovely little chanson, <i>To B. W. B.</i> (now Mrs. Duncan
Campbell Scott), but something in the lilting
cadence enchains the reader:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The world is spinning for change<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life has rapid wings;<br />
  Oh, one needs a steady heart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to falter while he sings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But this is made for my Dear One<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are far apart,<br />
  That she may have, wherever she goes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A song of mine in her heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A song that will serve as an anchor,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compass, and pilot, and chart,<br />
  A song that will bid her remember<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Love is the crown of Art.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With a star from her open window<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cuckoo wakes with a start:<br />
  Oh, can she ever forget me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a song of mine in her heart?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In <i>The Voice and the Dusk</i> what a play of colour:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The slender moon and one pale star,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rose leaf and a silver bee<br />
  From some god's garden blown afar,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go down the gold deep tranquilly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Within the south there rolls and grows<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty town with tower and spire,<br />
  From a cloud bastion masked with rose<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning flashes diamond fire."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A poet's <i>nom de plume</i> is that of "Katherine
Hale," so well known in private life as Mrs. John
W. Garvin, who to her own charm as a poet must
add still another as the wife of a poet and a critic
of distinction as well.  The gods endowed "Katherine
Hale" with a resplendent lyre, and her poems have
flown to many lands.  Perhaps no poem of the war
has more closely touched the universal heart than
has "Katherine Hale's" poem, so intense in its
restrained power, entitled <i>Grey Knitting</i>, so widely
known that from it only these three stanzas will
be given:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "All through the country, in the autumn stillness,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A web of grey spreads strangely, rim to rim;<br />
  And you may hear the sound of knitting needles.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incessant, gentle&mdash;dim.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A tiny click of little wooden needles,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elfin amid the gianthood of war;<br />
  Whispers of women, tireless and patient,<br />
  Who weave the web afar.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I like to think that soldiers, gayly dying<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the white Christ on fields with shame sown deep,<br />
  May hear the fairy click of women's needles<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they fall fast asleep."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
What a spell of potent witchery she weaves in her
song <i>I used to Wear a Gown of Green</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I used to wear a gown of green<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing a song to May,<br />
  When apple blossoms starred the stream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Spring came up the way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I used to run along with Love<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By lanes the world forgets,<br />
  To find in an enchanted wood<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first frail violets.<br />
</p>

The poets have been the celebrants of many of
the historic epochs of Canada and the recorders
of her great names; and in this especial line John
Daniel Logan has rendered an interesting service
in his <i>Songs of the Makers of Canada</i>.  In these
Dr. Logan has celebrated Cartier as the "dauntless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
discoverer," Champlain as the "first Canadian,"
Laval as "the high-priest of knowledge," Wolfe
as the "illustrious victor," Brock the "valiant
leader," Drummond the "indomitable soldier,"
Ryerson the "renowned educator," Howe the
"champion of self-government," Macdonald the
"great confederationist," Laurier the "prophetic
imperialist."  Such a collection, in its vigour and
vividness of personal characterisation, is the very
intellectual panorama of Canada.  Of Macdonald,
the "great confederationist," the First Premier of
the Dominion (1867), we find Dr. Logan saying:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Macdonald, though thy soul hath passed away<br />
  From wonted wolds in our Canadian land,<br />
  Where thou wast chiefest of the fervid band<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sought to give the people fullest sway<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er their own destiny, thy spirit goes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triumphant in this Canada of ours<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resplendent now before the elder Pow'rs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who mark how virile our young nation grows!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thy wisdom was the vision of a seer<br />
  Who knew the meaning of the pregnant days<br />
  Which gen'rous Time should father into ways<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unity...."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the memorial lyric to William Henry
Drummond, whom Dr. Logan enshrines as "Sovereign
of Joy and Prince of Tears," the poet touches
perhaps his most musical note in the lines:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Lost Canadian Singer of the winsome lays,<br />
  How farest thou along the Elysium ways,&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art thou companionless as we<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorrowing?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O gentle heart, we wonder if thou farest happily<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Homer and the Attic strain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Milton and the Tragic train."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Among the younger Canadian poets are two
sisters, Annie Campbell Huestis and Ethel Huestis
Butler, who have each won distinction.  One little
lyric of Mrs. Butler's, <i>On Life's Highway</i>, is
singularly poetic in its motive, contrasting the
experiences of walking as companioned with Grief, or with
Joy, and is expressed with much tenderness of
feeling.  The work of Miss Huestis suggests that she
makes her pilgrimages to the "holy hill," and
brings away with her all the fragrance of the thyme.
A poem of hers entitled <i>Aldaran, the Singer</i>, has
somewhat of that sustained sweetness and music
that so signally characterised Mrs. Browning's
<i>Catarina to Camoens</i>.  From Miss Huestis's <i>Aldaran</i>
are these extracts:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Aldaran, who loved to sing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lieth dead.<br />
  All the glory of the spring,<br />
  All its birds and blossoming,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near his still bed<br />
  Cannot waken him again.<br />
  Cannot lure to hill and plain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldaran, the Singer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Aldaran, who loved to sing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lieth low;<br />
  Not again his heart shall spring<br />
  At the time of blossoming,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, who can know?<br />
  Still at dusk or break of day,<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
  Some can hear him on his way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldaran, the vanished one,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking, hidden, in the sun;<br />
  Moving, mist-like, by the streams<br />
  When the early twilight dreams;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speeding on his quiet way,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never seen by night or day,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But in pity drawing near<br />
  To the help of those who fear.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beds of those who die,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing low their lullaby,<br />
  Singing still, when they are far<br />
  Where the mist and silence are,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing softly still that they<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May not fear the hidden way.<br />
  So, to those whose day is sped,<br />
  In the hour lone and dread,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cometh Aldaran, the Singer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is dead!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For her <i>Magdalen</i>, whose beauty of phrasing
attracted attention when published in a leading
critical review of New York, and in which there is
a haunting reminiscence of Christina Rossetti, room
must here be made, as it represents Miss Huestis in
what is perhaps her most artistic mood:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Where are you going, weary feet.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet that have failed in storm and flood?<br />
  'I go to find a flower sweet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left, fresh growing, near a wood.<br />
  The winds blow pure from many a hill,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hush to tender stillness there.<br />
  Shall not this restless heart be still,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grow more innocent and fair?'<br />
  '<i>Not so; for sin and bitter pain<br />
  Can never find Youth's flower again!</i>'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Where are you going, wistful face,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face with the mark of shame and tears?'<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
  'I go to find a quiet place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no one sees and no one hears.<br />
  The beauty and the silence there<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall thrill me through and still my pain.<br />
  Shall touch my hardness into prayer,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give me back my dreams again.'<br />
  '<i>Not so; for Sin has closed the door<br />
  On Youth's fair dreams forevermore.</i>'"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Where are you going, heart of woe.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitiful heart of fear and shame?'<br />
  'A strange and lonely way I go,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where none shall pity, none shall blame.<br />
  Far with my sin and misery<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I creep on doubtful feet, alone;<br />
  No human heart can follow me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mark my tears or hear my moan.'<br />
  '<i>Nay; but the never-ceasing sting,<br />
  The clearness of remembering!</i>'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'What do you see, O changing face,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alight with strange and tender gleams?'<br />
  'I near the hushed and holy place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of One who gives me back my dreams.'<br />
  'Where are you daring, eager feet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet that so wild a way have trod?'<br />
  'O bitter world, no scorn I meet.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinful and hurt, I go to God!<br />
  <i>On my dark sin, forevermore,<br />
  A sinless Hand has closed the door.</i>'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Miss Huestis dons her singing-robes too
infrequently; but who may venture on any prediction
regarding the poetic production of one who is still
on the threshold of achievement?  For the poet,
himself, least of all, may foresee his own future, nor
is it given to those who love his songs to discern his
future in the magic glass.  The poet is ever a subject
in a kingdom of untraced laws and unmapped
territory.

Louis Frechette is the French-Canadian Laureate,
who was crowned by the French Academy, in 1881,
for the striking merit of his tragedy, <i>Papineau</i>.
Doctor Frechette (born in 1841) has contributed
greatly to the fame of his country.  In his <i>La
Decouverte du Mississippi</i>, and in <i>Le Drapeau Anglais</i>,
<i>Saint-Malo</i>, and others, is his real distinction felt.
His poems are so long and so closely woven as hardly
to lend themselves to extracts.
</p>

<p>
Thomas O'Hagan is one of the favourite poets of
the Dominion, and aside from his own notable
contribution to poetry, he has done and is doing a
wonderful work in his scholarly and critical lectures
on poets.  His published lectures interpretative of
Shakespeare, of Dante, and of Browning, Tennyson,
Longfellow, and others, are in constant demand.
In <i>A Gate of Flowers</i>, <i>An Idyll of the Farm</i>, <i>The
Bugle Call</i>, and the timely production <i>I Take Off
my Hat to Albert</i>, are poems that inspire the popular
favour; and in a lyric entitled <i>Ripened Fruit</i> these
stanzas are especially calculated to awaken response:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I know not what my heart hath lost;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot strike the chords of old:<br />
  The breath that charmed my morning life<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath chilled each leaf within the wold.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The swallows twitter in the sky,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bare the nest within the eaves;<br />
  The fledglings of my care are gone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And left me but the rustling leaves.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And yet, I know my life hath strength,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And firmer hope and sweeter prayer,<br />
  For leaves that murmur on the ground<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have now for me a double care.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The glory of the summer sky<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May change to tints of autumn hue;<br />
  But faith that sheds its amber light<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will lend our heaven a tender blue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O altar of eternal youth!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O faith that beckons from afar.<br />
  Give to our lives a blossomed fruit&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give to our morns an evening star!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Very distinctive is the work of Doctor William
Henry Drummond, the poet of the "habitant" life.
<i>De Nice Leetle Canadienne</i> and <i>Leetle Bateese</i> have
become household songs.  In the former one stanza
runs:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O she's quick, an' she's smart, an' got plaintee heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know correc' way go about;<br />
  An' if you don' know, she soon tole you so.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Den tak' de firs' chance an' get out;<br />
  But if she love you, I spik it for true,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will mak' it more beautiful den,<br />
  An' sun on de sky can't shine lak' de eye<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dat nice leetle Canadienne."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<i>Leetle Bateese</i> is a favourite with reciters who
master the dialect, and who frequently delight their
audiences by the mingled humour and tenderness
of the picture:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Too sleepy for sayin' de prayer to-night?<br />

John W. Garvin, who has manifested his devotion
to the muses by compiling a notable anthology of
Canadian poets (recently published), is also a poet
of recognition, and one of his productions, entitled
<i>Majesty</i>, is especially original in conception.
Mr. Garvin's devotion to the poetic literature of his
country has rendered great service in the way of
making the poets known to the general reading
public and bringing together, within convenient
limits, much that is best in poetic art.
</p>

<p>
The names come to mind of Alfred Gordon, a
young and gifted English poet now a resident of
Montreal; of Ethelyn Wetherald, Robert Norwood,
E. Pauline Johnson, the daughter of Chief Johnson
of the Mohawks; of Virna Sheard, Alma Frances
McCollum, Albert D. Watson, William McLennan,
and William Douw Lighthall (whose recognition
extends far beyond his native country); of Charles
Mair, whose <i>Tecumseh</i> contains much that is excellent
in poetic lore.  Marjorie L. C. Pickthall has already
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
established a claim to the wide recognition that
opens before her, and her poem <i>The Lamp of
Poor Souls</i> must be especially remembered.  Jean
Blewett is one of the most thoughtful and beautiful
of the present choir of singers.  Mrs. Blewett is
Canadian born, and something of the high seriousness
of life that characterises the Reverend Canon
Scott seems reflected in the poems of Mrs. Blewett;
as in the following, entitled <i>Discontent</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My soul spoke low to Discontent:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long hast thou lodged with me,<br />
  Now, ere the strength of me is spent,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be quit of thee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thy presence means revolt, unrest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Means labour, longing, pain;<br />
  Go, leave me, thou unwelcome guest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor trouble me again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then something strong and sweet and fair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose up and made reply:<br />
  Who gave you the desire to dare<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do the right?  'Twas I.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The coward soul craves pleasant things,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft joys and dear delights&mdash;<br />
  I scourged you till you spread your wings<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soared to nobler heights.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You know me but imperfectly&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My surname is Divine;<br />
  God's own right hand did prison me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this soul of thine,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Lest thou, forgetting work and strife,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its battles and unrest."<br />

Helena Coleman has much of that spiritualisation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
of vision which was so evident in Adelaide Proctor,
and which was exalted to the supremest poetic art
by Mrs. Browning.  From Miss Coleman's <i>Love's
Higher Way</i> these stanzas are taken:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Constrain me not!  Dost thou not know<br />
  That if I turn from thee my face<br />
  'Tis but to hide the overflow<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Of love?  We need a little space<br />
  And solitude in which to kneel<br />
  And thank our God for this high grace<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "That He hath set His holy seal<br />
  Upon our lives.  My heart doth burn<br />
  With consciousness of all I feel<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And own to thee, and if I turn<br />
  For one brief moment from thy gaze,<br />
  'Tis but that I may better learn<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "To bear the unaccustomed blaze<br />
  Of that white light that like a flame<br />
  Thy love has set amidst my days."<br />
</p>

Of Isabella Valancy Crawford, who flashed like a
glancing star across Canadian skies, and whose death
in 1887 (at the age of thirty-six) was a signal loss
to her adopted country, Mr. Garvin, at once her
biographer and the editor of the complete edition
of her poems, well says: "A great poet dwelt among
us and we scarce knew her."  William Douw
Lighthall pronounces Isabella Valancy Crawford the
most impressive Canadian poet next to Roberts.
"This wonderful girl, living in the 'Empire'
Province of Ontario, early saw the possibilities of
the new field around her, and had she lived longer
might have made a really matchless name.  It was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
only in 1884 that her modest volume came out.  The
sad story of unrecognised genius and death was
re-enacted."
</p>

<p>
This volume of Miss Crawford's was handicapped
by an infelicitous title.  <i>Old Spookses' Pass;
Malcolm's Katie, and other Poems</i>, was hardly a
description to invite further investigation.  The book passed
almost unnoticed, and within three years its author
died. "She was a high-spirited, passionate girl,"
says Mr. Lighthall, "and there is little doubt that
the neglect of her book was the cause of her death.
Afterward her verse was seen to be phenomenal....
It was packed with fine stuff."
</p>

<p>
<i>Malcolm's Katie</i> is the story of a man and a maid,
the man going forth in the woodlands to hew a home
with his axe, and the maid remaining in faith and
devotion in her home.  It is a long poem in blank
verse, strewn with occasional lyrics, of which one
runs:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Love builds on the azure sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love builds on the golden sand,<br />
  And Love builds on the rose-winged cloud,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes Love builds on the land!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O if Love build on sparkling sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if Love build on golden strand,<br />
  And if Love build on rosy cloud,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Love these are the solid land!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Love will build his lily walls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love his pearly roof will rear<br />
  On cloud, or land, or mist, or sea&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's solid land is everywhere!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Lighthall is himself a poet of distinction and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
one of the best translators of French poetry.  Among
his finest work is a poem on Homer, breathing
the very spirit of classic ages.  Another is entitled
<i>Canada Not Last</i>, a sonnet series to Venice, Florence,
and Rome, the concluding sonnet, which follows,
relating to Canada:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Rome, Florence, Venice&mdash;noble, fair, and quaint,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reign in robes of magic round me here;<br />
  But fading blotted, dim, a picture faint,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With spell more silent only pleads a tear.<br />
  Plead not!  Thou hast my heart, O picture dim!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the fields, I see the autumn hand<br />
  Of God upon the maples!  Answer Him<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With weird, translucent glories, ye that stand<br />
  Like spirits in scarlet and in amethyst!<br />
  I see the sun break over you; the mist<br />
  On hills that lift from iron bases grand<br />
  Their heads superb!&mdash;the dream, it is my native land!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Another genuine poet is Peter McArthur, one
time editor of New York <i>Truth</i> and now farming at
his old home in Ontario.  Mr. McArthur has published
but one volume of verse, but that volume is enough
to place him securely well up among the truly
authentic voices in the Canadian choir.  Everything
he writes has a markedly individual quality.  There
is nothing in him, as one writer has said, of the mere
æsthetic or dilettante; he is alive to his finger tips.
Mr. McArthur has a keen eye and ear for the common
things of the life about him, as witness <i>A Thaw</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The farmhouse fire is dull and black,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trailing smoke rolls white and low<br />
  Along the fields till by the wood<br />
  It banks and floats unshaken, slow;<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P277"></a>277}</span>
  The scattering sounds seem near and loud,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising sun is clear and white.<br />
  And in the air a mystery stirs<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wintry hosts in coward flight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Anon the south wind breathes across<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen earth its bonds to break,<br />
  Till at the call of life returned<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It softly stirs but half awake.<br />
  The cattle clamour in their stalls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house-dog barks, he knows not why.<br />
  The cock crows by the stable door,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow-birds, sombre-hued, go by.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The busy housewife on the snow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bleach lays out her linen store,<br />
  And scolds because with careless feet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children track the spotless floor.<br />
  With nightfall comes the slow warm rain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purl of waters fills the air,<br />
  And save where roll the gleaming drifts<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fields lie sullen, black, and bare."<br />

But Mr. McArthur does not write simply of the
life around him; the life within is of greater import
to him.  Here, as evidence of this, is a fine sonnet of
his, entitled <i>Summum Bonum</i>.  Mr. McArthur, it
might be noted in passing, is a real master of the
sonnet for all his few accomplishments in that form
of verse:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "How blest is he that can but love and do,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has no skill of speech nor trick of art<br />
  Wherewith to tell what faith approveth true<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show for fame the treasures of his heart.<br />
  When wisely weak upon the path of duty<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine accord has made his footing sure<br />
  With humble deeds he builds his life to beauty,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong to achieve and patient to endure.<br />
  But they that in the market-place we meet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each with his trumpet and his noisy faction,<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
  Are leaky vessels, pouring on the street<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth they know ere it hath known its action:<br />
  Yet which, think ye, in His benign regard,<br />
  Or words or deeds shall merit the reward?<br />
</p>

Agnes Maule Machar is another of the group of
patriotic poets whose theme is often that of the
Empire.  She discerns the imperial conditions, and
she is intensely in sympathy with the richness and
beauty of the land.  In Miss Machar's <i>A Prayer for
Dominion Day</i> these fine lines occur:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O God of nations, who hast set her place<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the rising and the setting day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her part in this world's changeful course to play,<br />
  Soothe the conflicting passions that we trace<br />
  In her unrestful eyes&mdash;grant her the grace<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know the one true, perfect love, that may<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give noble impulse to her onward way&mdash;<br />
  God's love, that doth all other love embrace!"<br />
</p>

Lloyd Roberts, one of the young poets of the
Dominion, the eldest living son of Charles G. D. Roberts,
is true to his poetic birthright, and is the
author of an impressive war poem, <i>Come Quietly,
England</i>, which opens as follows:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Come quietly, England, all together, come!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time!<br />
  We have waited, weighed, and blundered, wondered<br />
  Who had blundered;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stared askance at one another<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our brother slew our brother,<br />
  And went about our business,<br />
  Saying, 'It will be all right&mdash;some day.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the soldiers do the killing&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they're willing&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the sailors do the manning,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a little blood won't move it,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a flood-tide of emotions.'<br />
  Well, now we know the truth<br />

One of the most brilliant of Canadian poets is
Arthur Stringer, though he is more widely known
as a novelist, his <i>Silver Poppy</i> and <i>Wire Tappers</i>
having been the successes of their day.  Mr. Stringer's
poetic work is striking for its variety and range.  He
has written lyrics and sonnets of almost Keats-like
quality, and with as ready facility has written poems
in the most modern form of <i>vers libre</i>.  Then he has
turned to the literature of ancient Greece and given
us such things of pure beauty in blank verse as
<i>Hephæstus</i> and <i>Sappho in Leucadia</i>, which do not
shrink in comparison with any other modern work
of their kind; and again has presented us with such
pitilessly realistic and convincing pictures as <i>The
Woman in the Rain</i>.  He has also written verse of
the Celtic order, his volume of <i>Irish Poems</i> being a
well of true Irish humour and feeling.  And yet,
withal, Stringer is Canadian in every nerve and fibre
of him.  Listen to his <i>Going Home</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I tread each mountain waste austere,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass dark pinelands, hill by hill;<br />
  Each tardy sunrise brings me near,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each lonely sunset nearer still.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P281"></a>281}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sing low, my heart, of other lands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And suns we may have loved, or known:<br />
  This silent North, it understands,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asks but little of its own!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "So where the homeland twilight broods<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the slopes of dusky pine,<br />
  Teach me your silence, solitudes;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your reticence, grey hills, be mine!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Whether all loveliness it lies,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or but a lone waste scarred and torn,<br />
  How shall I know?  For 'neath these skies<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this valley I was born."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Here is a characteristic poem of Stringer's
entitled <i>War</i>, written years ago, and yet reading as
if the ink in which it was written were still wet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "From hill to hill he harried me;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stalked me day and night.<br />
  He neither knew nor hated me;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not his nor mine the fight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He killed the man who stood by me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such they made his law.<br />
  Then foot by foot I fought to him,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who neither knew nor saw.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I aimed my rifle at his heart;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leapt up in the air.<br />
  My screaming ball tore through his breast,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay embedded there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Lay but embedded there, and yet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hissed home o'er hill and sea,<br />
  Straight to the aching heart of one<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who'd wronged not mine nor me."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As a specimen of Stringer's skill in handling of
blank verse, here is a portion of the farewell between
Sappho and Phaon in <i>Sappho in Leucadia</i>:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P282"></a>282}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sappho</i>.  But you,&mdash;<br />
  You will forget me, Phaon; there the sting.<br />
  The sorrow of the grave is not its green<br />
  And the salt tear upon its violet;<br />
  But the long years that bring the grey neglect,<br />
  When the glad grasses smooth the little mound,&mdash;<br />
  When leaf by leaf the tree of sorrow wanes<br />
  And on the urn unseen the tarnish comes,<br />
  And tears are not so bitter as they were,<br />
  Time sings so low to our bereavèd ears,&mdash;<br />
  So softly breathes, that, bud by falling bud,<br />
  The garden of fond Grief all empty lies<br />
  And unregretted dip the languid oars<br />
  Of Charon thro' the gloom, and then are gone.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Phaon</i>.  Red-lipped and breathing woman, made for love,<br />
  How can this clamouring heart of mine forget?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sappho</i>.  You will forget, e'en though you would or no,<br />
  And the long years shall leave you free again;<br />
  And in some other Spring when other lips<br />
  Let fall my name, you will remember not.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Phaon</i>.  Enough,&mdash;but let me kiss the heavy rose<br />
  Of your red mouth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sappho</i>.  Not until Death has kissed<br />
  It white as these white garments, and has robed<br />
  This body for its groom.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Another characteristic poem of Stringer's, entitled
<i>A Prayer in Defeat</i>, will bear comparison with
William Ernest Henley's famous <i>Unafraid</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Still hurl me back, God, if Thou must!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy wrath, see, I shall bear&mdash;<br />
  I have been taught to know the dust<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of battle and despair.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Bend not to me this hour, O God,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I defeated stand;<br />
  I have been schooled to bear thy rod,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still wait, not unmanned!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But should some white hour of success<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweep me where, vine-like, lead<br />
  The widening roads, the clamouring press&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thy lash shall need!<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then, in that hour of triumph keen,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For then I ask thine aid;<br />
  God of the weak, on whom I lean,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep me then unafraid!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Space cannot be found for it here, but following
are a few verses from another beautiful poem,
<i>St. Ives' Poor</i>.  The idea of this poem is found in the
old saying that in the giving of alms the Christ is
revealed:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "For O, my Lord, the house-dove knows her nest<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above my window builded from the rain;<br />
  In the brown mere the heron finds her rest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these shall seek in vain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And O, my Lord, the thrush may fold his wing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curlew seek the long lift of the seas,<br />
  The wild swan sleep amid his journeying;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place for these.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thy dead are sheltered; housed and warmed they wait<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the golden fern, the falling foam;<br />
  But these Thy living wander desolate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have not any home."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And here is an exquisite poem, <i>The Immortal</i>,
which is full of Miss Pickthall's own music:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Beauty is still immortal in our eyes,<br />
  When sways no more the spirit-haunted reed,<br />
  When the wild grape shall build<br />
  No more her canopies,<br />
  When blows no more the moon-grey thistle seed,<br />
  When the last bell has lulled the white flocks home,<br />
  When the last eve has stilled<br />
  The wandering wing, and touched the dying foam,<br />
  When the last moon burns low, and, spark by spark,<br />
  The little worlds die out along the dark&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Beauty that rosed the moth-wing, touched the land<br />
  With clover-horns and delicate faint flowers;<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
  Beauty that bade the showers<br />
  Beat on the violet's face,<br />
  Shall hold the eternal heavens within their place,<br />
  And hear new stars come singing from God's hand."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We cannot resist, before leaving Miss Pickthall,
quoting a lovely little lyric of hers called simply
<i>Serenade</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Dark is the Iris meadow,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark is the ivory tower,<br />
  And lightly the young moth's shadow<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeps on the passion flower.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Gone are our day's red roses,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely and lost and few,<br />
  But the first star uncloses<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver bud in the blue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Night, and a flame in the embers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the seal of the years was set;<br />
  When the almond bough remembers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall my heart forget?"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Passing mention has been made of the names of
Ethelwyn Wetherald and Pauline Johnson, but the
work of these poets is too distinctive to avoid some
reference to it.  Miss Wetherald has published some
half-dozen books of verse, all made up chiefly of
short lyrics, and all possessing an individual quality
which may well be called unique.  Here is one of her
strongest poems, entitled <i>Prodigal Yet</i>:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Muck of the sty, reek of the trough,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackened my brow where all might see,<br />
  Yet while I was a great way off<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Father ran with compassion for me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He put on my hand a ring of gold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There's no escape from a ring, they say);<br />
  He put on my neck a chain to hold<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passionate spirit from breaking away.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He put on my feet the shoes that miss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No chance to tread in the narrow path;<br />
  He pressed on my lips the burning kiss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scorches deeper than fires of wrath.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He filled my body with meat and wine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flooded my heart with love's white light!<br />
  Yet deep in the mire, with sensuous swine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I long&mdash;God help me!&mdash;to wallow to-night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Muck of the sty, reek of the trough,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blacken my soul where none may see.<br />
  Father, I yet am a long way off&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come quickly.  Lord!  Have compassion on me!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It has been indicated that Pauline Johnson, whose
death a few years ago is still fresh in the memory of
those who knew her and her work, was Indian by
birth and her poetry is marked by the vigour and
virility which such a fact would imply.  <i>How Red
Men Can Die</i> and <i>The Cry of an Indian Wife</i> are
perhaps her best-known poems, but they are too
long to quote here.  Following, however, is a little
poem, <i>The Honey Bee</i>, which shows Miss Johnson's
keen feeling for colour, as well as her fine lyric
quality:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You are belted with gold, little brother of mine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow gold, like the sun<br />
  That spills in the west, as a chalice of wine<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When feasting is done.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You are gossamer-winged, little brother of mine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tissue winged, like the mist<br />
  That broods where the marshes melt into a line<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of vapour sun-kissed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You are laden with sweets, little brother of mine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sweets, like the touch<br />
  Of hands we have longed for, of arms that entwine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lips that love much.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P286"></a>286}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You are better than I, little brother of mine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than I, human-souled,<br />
  For you bring from the blossoms and red summer shine,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others, your gold."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

The poet has no country save that of the kingdom
of song, or rather, all countries are his own, and
while Canada cannot claim Robert W. Service by
birth, it is he who has so made himself the poet
of her scenic grandeur and her primitive human
experiences in the deepest emotions of life, love,
death, sacrifice, revenge, that no sketch of Canadian
poetry could omit the name of one who has made
the Dominion known, in its grandeur and its
mountain solitudes, the world over.  Mr. Service
has inevitably been much quoted in these pages;
no one can travel in Canada, no one can write of
Canada, without this perpetual consciousness of the
vivid way in which he has translated her landscapes
and her life.  What a ring of the vitality that
conquers the wilderness is in his <i>Call of the Wild</i>!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Have you suffered, starved, and triumphed, grovelled down,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet grasped at glory,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?<br />
  'Done things' just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?<br />
  Have you seen God in His splendours, heard the text that<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nature renders<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You'll never hear it in the family pew),<br />
  The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things?&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then listen to the wild&mdash;it's calling you.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their preaching,<br />
  They have soaked you in convention through and through;<br />
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P287"></a>287}</span>
  They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teaching&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can't you hear the wild?&mdash;it's calling you.<br />
  Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us journey to a lonely land I know.<br />
  There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guide us,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wild is calling, calling ... let us go."<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Robert Service has many moods, and in the tender
little lyric <i>Unforgotten</i> he dramatises the way in
which one's real life lies in his consciousness rather
than enchained with the bodily presence:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I know a garden where the lilies gleam,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one who lingers in the sunshine there;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is than white-stoled lily far more fair.<br />
  And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream.<br />
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P288"></a>288}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary&mdash;then<br />
  He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And ah, it's strange, for desolate and dim<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he is in the garden by her side<br />
  And she is in the garret there with him."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One of the wonderful poems of Mr. Service is
that of <i>My Madonna</i>.  The artist "haled" him "a
woman from the street" for his model; he painted
her:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I painted her as she might have been<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Worst had been the Best,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and she "laughed at the picture and went away,"
but a connoisseur came and exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis Mary, the Mother of God."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "So I painted a halo round her hair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I sold her, and took my fee,<br />
  And she hangs in the church of Saint Hilaire,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you and all may see."<br />

No attempt to transcribe any impressions of
Canada could attain to success that did not include
some reference, even one so slight and imperfect
as this, to her poets.  Any adequate comment on
her poetic literature would fill more than one volume
of itself.  They who make the songs of a people are
traditionally held to be not less in influence than are
they who make her laws; and that the future will
be still more enriched with the enthusiasms and the
strange and thrilling elements of the life of the
Dominion is a foregone conclusion.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
THE CALL OF THE CANADIAN WEST
</h3>

<p>
The call of the Canadian West is far less the call
of the adventurer, of the speculator, of the seeker
of vast and sudden wealth than it is the call to carry
an enlightened civilisation into the vast new region
that beckons to humanity invested with all the
alluring glory of the Promised Land.  It is nearly
three hundred years ago that the Pilgrim Fathers
landed in New England to conquer the wilderness.
But the Pilgrims did not find that the railways had
gone before and prepared the way with luxurious
trains of Pullman cars, or that telegraph and
telephone service, in all varieties, to say nothing
of Marconigrams, daily mails, motor cars, and
various other amenities of life, were awaiting them.
The New England of to-day is more indebted to the
past half century for its advance than it is to the
preceding two and a half centuries.  So it may be
fairly claimed that the Canadian West begins with
the degree of progress, so far as mechanical
conveniences and resources go, to which older countries
have but just advanced.  It is the heir of all the
ages.
</p>

<p>
In normal times, before the War, there was an
annual immigration into Canada that approximated
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>
to the number of four hundred thousand people,
of whom more than fifty thousand were from
the United States.  There was said to be in round
numbers from fifty to seventy thousand who were
neither from the States nor from the British Isles,
while the remainder were chiefly from England,
Scotland, or Wales.  The Irish immigration is more
attracted to the States, as more than twelve millions
of their race are already incorporated into the
population of that country.
</p>

<p>
Two leading factors produce this large immigration
into the Dominion.  One is that Canada is a
country whose richness of resources, climatic
conditions, and scenic beauty are incomparable; the
other is that there are wise and liberal provisions
made by the government to offer desirable and
attractive conditions and judicious inducements
to the right sort of men to establish their homes
in Canada.  Thousands of prosperous farmers
already scattered over Western Canada began, not
many years ago, with inconsiderable capital, but
their intelligence, industry, and integrity have
carried the way and developed conditions of living
that are eminently satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
The excellent character of the land in Western
Canada is well displayed in the great region opened
up by the Grand Trunk Pacific.  Following for fifty
miles the valley of the Assiniboine River, the line of
railway goes through the drainage basin of Qu'Appelle
River, and on into the great basin of the south
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
Saskatchewan River, crossing it at Saskatoon, the
width of this basin being some 200 miles.  Then on
through the western part of Saskatchewan and the
eastern part of Alberta, the railway makes a gradual
ascent through sandhills and ridges until crossing
the third steppe it proceeds for the remaining 130
miles, to Edmonton, over a level country.  With
the exception, and that an inconsiderable one, of
these sandhills and ridges, there is no waste land
between Winnipeg and Edmonton.
</p>

<p>
In the whole region now opened to civilisation by
the Grand Trunk Pacific, there extends a belt of
rich farming land from 300 to 500 miles in width
from north to south and some 1000 miles in length
from east to west.  From Winnipeg to the west, the
physical properties of the land are found by trained
experts to be exceptionally advantageous for the
growing of wheat, oats, barley, and flax; "in fact,"
says Professor Clifford Willis (a recognised authority
on soil physics), "the yields of small grain of this
type were the best that I have seen anywhere in
the best tilled fields of the United States."  Professor
James H. Pettit, of Cornell University, who
won his doctor's degree from the University of
Göttingen for work in soil fertility and bacteriology,
finds that this recently opened up region possesses
some of the richest soils, and that this is due to the
alluvial deposits of the large area once covered by
the old glacial Lake Agassiz.  These deposits have
left a soil of silt and clay that is capable of producing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P292"></a>292}</span>
thirty-five or forty bushels of wheat, and eighty or
ninety bushels of oats to the acre.
</p>

<p>
To "mixed farming" as well as to the production
of grain alone, or of live stock, all this
enormous region lends itself.  Before the country
was opened and rendered accessible by the Grand
Trunk Pacific, the region was practically a wilderness.
The land was fertile, the numerous rivers and
the lakes provided a sufficiency of water and
generally promising conditions, but until transit was
provided all these were unavailing.  Prosperous
towns have now sprung up all along the line of the
railway, and the settlement of the country progresses
with incredible swiftness.  The settler arrives
with his twentieth-century equipment.  The contrast
between the manner in which Canada is being gracefully
and luxuriously settled, and that of the
mid-nineteenth-century settlement of the western part
of the United States, is something with which to
reckon.  The Canadian pioneer arrives in his Pullman
car instead of the "prairie schooner" that slowly
and wearily traversed the plains west of the Mississippi.
He starts a steam engine to plough the land,
and if trees or stumps come in his way he exterminates
them with celerity by machinery.  When the
harvesting time comes, wonderful mechanisms cut
the grain and bind it, while his trucks are perhaps
equipped with motor power and swiftly carry the
grain direct from the threshing-machines to the
elevators, from which it is shipped to market.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P293"></a>293}</span>
Wherefore, indeed, should he taste drudgery?  Is he not
the heir to all the ages?
</p>

<p>
The marked liberality of the Canadian Government
in its universal provision for higher education
is one of the features of the Dominion that can
never be too deeply emphasised.  Winnipeg, Saskatoon,
and Edmonton are all seats of universities,
whose privileges are open to women on equal terms.
At both Winnipeg and Saskatoon are also
agricultural colleges, offering practical instruction in
scientific farming, and the ways of wealth are at
once made plain for the youth of the region.

<p>
The telephone service is practically universal,
welding into unity all the labour on a great farm of
hundreds of acres, and enabling the farmhouse to
be in touch with city and town.  Appreciating the
importance of this, the government of each province
lends substantial aid in the instalment of telephone
service, and the main telephone lines in these three
western provinces are owned and operated by the
government.  Thus all agricultural communities
are linked together in close contact and communication.
</p>

<p>
Social conditions thereby establish themselves on
a satisfactory basis.  The comfort of the rural home
is assured.  There is no isolation to be encountered.
Good roads, railway facilities of the best order that
the world can afford, telephones, and telegraphs
make possible a social life impossible under former
pioneer conditions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
</p>

<p>
Churches spring up wherever there are people,
for religion and education go hand in hand in
Canada.
</p>

<p>
The garden facilities are not the least of the
attractions to settlers.  The abundance with which
garden stuff of all kinds&mdash;potatoes, peas, beans,
onions, turnips, pumpkins, and squash, as well as
lettuce, radishes, rhubarb, and small fruits&mdash;grow
in all this region is something to see.
</p>

<p>
This agricultural empire is so great in its promise
for the future, so interesting and enchaining in its
present development, that there is hardly a limit
to the imagination regarding its importance in a
not distant period.
</p>

<p>
The "great North-West" is a term which has
been commonly employed to designate the provinces
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the
northern part of British Columbia.  It is rather a
vague term; yet it indicates, if it does not exactly
define, a region of unrivalled scenic grandeur, and of
such potential resources and favourable conditions
of climate as to virtually add a new continent to the
world.  Such is the march of progress, however,
that at the time of writing the "North-West,"
strictly speaking, is that portion of the land north
of these provinces stretching eastward to Hudson
Bay and northward to the Arctic Ocean and including
that part of the Yukon on the Canadian side of
the Alaskan border.  This definition is according to
Watson Griffin's map of the Dominion of Canada in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
his accurate and authoritative work, <i>Canada of the
Twentieth Century</i>, which appeared in May, 1916,
bringing all matter pertaining to the country up to
date with statistical accuracy.  It is pointed out by
Mr. Griffin that in the older provinces, such as
Quebec and Ontario, the climate has been virtually
transformed by the culture of the soil.  In southern
Manitoba it is also on record that while the early
settlers lost their crops by summer frosts, no such
disasters are now experienced.  The experiments in
agriculture have proved that the soil under cultivation
stores up the heat received during the long,
bright days, and that the radiation of this heat at
night prevents the fatal frosts.  Climatic conditions
are not, therefore, arbitrary and fixed beyond control,
but are largely amenable to civilisation.  It is
this fact that lends probability to the expectation
of creating prosperous conditions for living in the
region north of the sixtieth parallel.  "In fact," says
Mr. Watson Griffin, "at some of the Hudson's Bay
Company posts in these territories the clearing,
draining, and cultivation of the land has already
had a remarkable effect, and if this is true where
very small areas have been brought under cultivation,
it is conceivable that the cultivation of wide
areas might have a very great influence in preventing
summer frosts."  If well-cultivated soil does
receive and store the sun's heat it seems reasonable
to suppose that in these northern districts, where
the summer days are so long, the general opening of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
the soil to the sun and air should have a marked
effect.
</p>

<p>
The most reliable experts unite in the conviction
that the Mackenzie Basin is capable of supporting
an agricultural population.  The soil is rich; and in
that part of the Basin alone, lying between Athabasca
Lake and the Arctic Ocean, there is a belt of land
940 miles long and over 60 miles wide.  Ninety
miles south of latitude sixty-three ripe strawberries
are found.  A little farther to the south currants
and other small fruits grow luxuriantly.  There are
already scanty settlements, remote and apart, in
this country, and an increasing population of
huntsmen, fur-traders, and tourists to whom sport is the
attraction; and the first consideration that would
occur to the traveller, or to any student of this
almost unmapped region of infinite space, would be
as to the ways and means for safeguarding human
life and for the maintenance of law and order.  For
untold centuries this region has been the home and
haunt of the Indians and of wild and ferocious
animals.  The Indian tribes possessed all this
district in which to roam at will.  Their means of
subsistence were hunting and fishing, and their resources
for clothing consisted in the skins and furs of
captured animals.  Any adequate conception of the
wildness of this unbroken wilderness is almost
impossible to grasp.  The primæval forests impenetrable
with their dense growth of underbrush, fallen trees,
colossal rocks washed bare by the beating storms of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
centuries, with uncounted and fairly innumerable
leagues of lakes, rivers, swamps&mdash;how unconquerable
this primitive world of Nature!  Yet the call of
the North-West, even this remote and unknown
North-West, has sounded, and the ear of poet,
prophet, and priest is that which registers the cry
unheard and unheeded by others.
</p>

<p>
It is a significant commentary on human life, in its
assertion of that divinity which man feels within
him, that the first white men to fare forth to
penetrate this wilderness were the French missionary
priests, and that the intense motive that drew them
into hardships and dangers incredible was that of
the love of God and the longing to make known to
the untamed Red Man the help and comfort of the
Divine Power&mdash;to bring to these children of nature
something of the message of a diviner destiny.
"To Pierre Radisson and his comrade, the Sieur
Groseillers, belong the credit of having first
penetrated this vast tract of undiscovered country,"
writes Mr. A. L. Haydon in his remarkable book,
<i>The Riders of the Plains</i>.  No romance was ever more
enthralling than this volume, nor would it be possible
to offer any adequate interpretation of the great
North-West that did not take account of Mr. Haydon's
work.  With the thrilling adventures of these French
missionaries all students of history are acquainted;
and it is such a chapter in life and in literature that
any transcription of the experiences would of itself
make a volume.  In its fulness it can only perhaps
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P298"></a>298}</span>
be found in the pages of the Recording Angel.  "They
plunged into the unknown," says Mr. Haydon;
"took the daring leap that all such pioneers are
called upon to take; and along the paths they blazed
followed a host of others hardly less intrepid.  He who
would read of the further discovery and exploitation
of the North-West of Canada must study the glowing
life-stories of Marquette, Joliet, La Salle, De la
Verendrye, and others."
</p>

<p>
There were also temporal as well as spiritual
leadings.  The adventurous fur-traders pushed further
and further into the primæval wilderness and established
forts as centres of supplies and as definite
places for their barter with the Indians.  Two separate
and important companies entered on this quest, the
famous Hudson's Bay Company and the North-West
Fur Company.  The outposts that each of these
energetic associations established were like lighted
torches into the darkness; even this untrodden
wilderness began to respond to the first conquest of
humanity.  Myths and traditions also led on.  There
were rumours in the air, whisperings of voices on the
wind, that some vast and unknown sea lay between
the western coast and Japan.  The Pacific Ocean
was known, but these nebulous intimations pointed
to a body of water never yet discovered.  In 1731
the Sieur De la Verendrye, as gallant a gentleman
as ever sought his fortune in the new world, started
gaily from Montreal upon the quest for this great
sea.  With his company he took the route up the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P299"></a>299}</span>
Red River to its junction with the Assiniboine,
making camp at Fort Rouge, the site of the present
city of Winnipeg.  Rumours still haunted the air of
"mighty waters beyond the mountains," and over
the infinite and trackless expanse of prairie they
still further extended the march, but the formidable
foothills of the Rocky Mountains proved too great a
barrier, and it was due to the persistence, and
probably, too, also to the greater physical vigour of a
young fur-trader, Alexander Mackenzie, of the
North-West Company, that the mysteries of the
mountain ranges were penetrated, the foothills
crossed, and the river traced that now bears his
name.
</p>

<p>
These two fur-trading companies became important
factors in the development of the North-West.
There was an intense rivalry between them, yet the
very intensity of the discord and ill feeling became
an added impetus in the rivalry of exploration.
Many and diverse qualities are brought into play in
the conquering of a wilderness.  Evil and good are
always sown together like the wheat and the tares,
and even the evil has its part to play and its work to
do.  Of this fierce rivalry between the two was born
that activity which created so large a number of
trading-posts, and the energy that founded numerous
settlements, many of which are now recognised as
prosperous centres.
</p>

<p>
In 1670, under the patronage of Prince Rupert,
there was incorporated the "Honourable Company
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P300"></a>300}</span>
of Merchant-Adventurers Trading into Hudson's
Bay," which developed later into the Hudson's Bay
Company.
</p>

<p>
Pierre Radisson and the Sieur Groseillers, both
among the most daring and heroic explorers the
world has known, excited a wave of enthusiasm in
England by the reports of the wilderness they carried
back with them.  For more than a century the
Company under the patronage of Prince Rupert
continued to carry on a prosperous business, and after
this was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company,
and again after the two rival associations united, a
splendid business was developed.  But while the
rivalry had conduced to enterprise and exploration,
the monopoly was as naturally concerned in not
making too widely known the rich resources that
might thus serve to attract other competitors.

<p>
Early in the nineteenth century a large Scotch
settlement, under the auspices of the Earl of Selkirk,
was established in the Red River region.  They
encountered almost every phase of hardship and
trial.  Great floods devastated their land and ruined
their attempts at agriculture.  The severe winters,
with their enshrouding snow-drifts, their icy blasts,
the imprisoning character of the elements, the
remoteness from any vestige of human habitations or
contact with civilisation, went far towards annihilating
even the most persistent efforts to found a
settlement that should withstand these conditions.
</p>

<p>
By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P301"></a>301}</span>
settlements of the great North-West had become so
numerous that there began to be requirements for
larger means of protection.  The Hudson's Bay
Company, at this time, held territory to the extent
of over two million square miles.  All this expanse
was admitted into the confederation, to the
reassurance and great satisfaction of the settlers
scattered over this wide region; but to the alarm
and prevailing dissatisfaction of another order of the
inhabitants, the French half-breeds, who were
themselves a force with which a reckoning had to be made.
Their alarm culminated in the Rebellion of 1869,
an outbreak suppressed by Colonel (later Lord)
Wolseley.  Soon after this outbreak was quelled
there came the formation of the Province of Manitoba,
and from this event there dated a new epoch
in the history of this part of the country.  The
conditions grew worse rather than better.  The United
States were also a contributing factor to greater
discord.  The treatment of the Indians by the
government of the States had apparently left much
to be desired (to put it mildly) and the turbulent
warfare that went on almost continually in the
western part of that country drove many of the
Indian tribes into frenzy.  Many of these tribes now
crossed the border line into Canada to seek British
protection.  There were at this time in Canada some
seventy thousand Indians to whom the Imperial
government had promised protection, and the coming
of these fresh tribes from the States, largely, too,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
in conditions of revolt and resentment at what they
felt to be unjust and cruel treatment, could not but
be regarded with grave apprehensions by the white
settlers.  They were alarmed at the close proximity
of these unknown savage tribes as well as apprehensive
of the effect they might produce on the Canadian
Indians.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1872 the Canadian Adjutant-General,
Colonel Robertson-Ross, was dispatched
by the Government of the Dominion to make a tour
of inspection through the North-West.  He found
that a party of lawless traders and smugglers from
the States had established a trading-post which they
had named Fort Hamilton, about sixty miles north
of the border-line between the Dominion and the
United States; and that they were conducting a
species of barter with the Blackfeet Indians, supplying
them with firearms and with ardent spirits, in
direct opposition to the laws of both countries.
They were paying no customs duty for the
merchandise they were thus introducing into Canada.
Colonel Robertson-Ross found the demoralisation
that they were working to be very great and of great
injury, not only to the Indians, but to the entire
country.  "At Fort Edmonton," said the Adjutant-General
in his Report, "whisky was openly sold to
the Blackfeet and other Indians trading at the Fort
by smugglers from the United States, who derived
large profits therefrom, and whom, on being remonstrated
with by the official in charge of Hudson's Bay
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
Post, coolly replied that they very well knew they
were defying the laws, but as there was no force to
prevent them they would do as they pleased."
</p>

<p>
All this inciting to intemperance and brawling
led to other offences against law and order.  The
Indians took to horse-stealing, and the entire
population of the North-West was at their mercy.
Neither property nor life was safe.  On dishonesty
and robbery followed murder as a not uncommon
occurrence and other crimes of a serious nature
were not infrequent.  Sir John Macdonald was at
this time the Premier of Canada.  It was on his
initiative that Colonel Robertson-Ross had been
sent on this reconnaissance to find out to what
extent the lawless marauders were demoralising the
entire country and the nature of the protection and
safeguards that should be instituted for the
population.  The Adjutant-General earnestly recommended
the establishment of a trained and disciplined
military body, to be subject to its own rules, and to
be distinct from any civil force, though acting as
an addition to whatever civil force might also be
formed.  "Whatever feeling may be entertained
toward policemen, animosity is rarely, if ever, felt
toward disciplined soldiers wearing her Majesty's
uniform in any portion of the British Empire,"
stated Colonel Robertson-Ross, and he added: "In
the event of serious disturbance a police force,
acting alone and unsupported by a disciplined
military body, would probably be overpowered in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P304"></a>304}</span>
province of mixed races, where every man is armed,
while to maintain a military without any civil force
is not desirable."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Robertson-Ross also urgently recommended
that a chain of military posts should be
established from Manitoba to the Rocky Mountains;
that a stipendiary magistrate for the Saskatchewan
should be appointed, who should also act as an
Indian Commissioner and who should fix his residence
in Edmonton.  "The individual to fill this post,"
he said, "should be one, if possible, already known
to the Indians, and one in whom they have
confidence."  He also pointed out that this Indian
Commissioner should always be accompanied by a
military force.  "A large force is not necessary,"
he said; "but the presence of a certain force will, I
believe, be found indispensable for the security of
the country, to prevent bloodshed and preserve
peace."
</p>

<p>
This is the story of the way in which the Royal
North-West Mounted Police of Canada came into
being.  These "Riders of the Plains" stand alone
and unparalleled in the world in their organisation,
their peculiar field of work, and the nature of their
control over the vast region entrusted to their care.
This Mounted Police Force comprises about six
hundred officers and men, whose territory is an area
as extensive as all Central Europe, or a region five
times as large as Great Britain; extending for two
thousand miles from east to west, and a thousand
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P305"></a>305}</span>
miles from north to south.  In this great area are
twelve divisional posts and one hundred and fifty
detachments.  The organisation of this body was
carried out in the autumn of 1873.  The first one
hundred and fifty of the Mounted Police were
stationed at Lower Fort Garry in Manitoba.  They
were under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
George A. French, an officer of the Royal Artillery
who had been the Inspector of Artillery at the
School of Gunnery in Kingston, Ontario.  Colonel
French at once, on arriving in Manitoba, urged upon
the Government the need of strengthening the force
by at least doubling the number of men.  Two
hundred more were enlisted in Toronto, and the
expedition to the Far West was fixed for an early date
in the spring.

Mounted Police is notable.  It was Sir John
Macdonald's idea that the dominant note in their
uniform should be scarlet as "this colour conveys the
strongest impression to the mind of the Indian,
through his respect for 'the Queen's soldiers.'"  To
accentuate the military character of the force and
to distinguish them from the blue-coated soldiers
of the States was a point of real importance.
</p>

<p>
This first detachment of the Royal Mounted
Police made an expedition in the summer of 1874
into the very heart of the Blackfeet country, and
returned to Dufferin in November, having made an
effective campaign in the interests of law and order,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P306"></a>306}</span>
from which very important and momentous results
have ensued since that time.  That the small body
of less than seven hundred men should exercise
such control, not only over so vast an area of almost
unknown wilderness, inhabited by such a diversity
of human beings scattered widely apart, is practically
an isolated fact in all history.  To this magnificent
Force is largely due, to-day, the conditions that
invest the North-West with such promise and
prosperity.
</p>

<p>
"The Force may be said to have largely completed
the work it originally set out to do," writes Frank
Yeigh[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]; "so far as the frontier provinces are
concerned, a work that is worth many times its cost, as
an object-lesson of the power and authority of
government existing behind all real civilisation."

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Still, the task of the mounted patroller is by no
means yet completed.  The present force costs the
country nearly three-quarters of a million dollars a
year.  Their outposts are being set farther and
farther afield.  Thus, from the promontory of Cape
Chidley, at almost the most northerly point of
Labrador, the barracks overlook Hudson Straits;
another guards Hudson Bay, while a third protects
the Arctic seaboard, and the most western post
serves to protect the gold land of the Yukon.  It is
a fact, and a striking one, that on the three-hundred-mile
road from White Horse to Dawson the traveller
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P307"></a>307}</span>
is as safe as in any part of Canada.  Of the life of this
Royal Force Mr. Haydon says:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The stories of the daily life of these rough-riders of the
plains are the very essence of romance, of high courage, of
Herculean tasks performed and great difficulties overcome.
The Mounted Police kept down lawlessness when the
Canadian Pacific Railway was being built, they fought
bravely during the Riel Rebellion of 1885, they kept well
in hand the gold rush to the Klondyke in 1889-90, and not
a few served in South Africa during the Boer War.  But the
deeds of the individual men call for high praise.  Their
qualities of fidelity, devotion to duty, and their fearlessness
are constantly being exemplified.  A thousand miles on the
ice, 'mushing' by dog-team and komatik, through unexplored
haunts of bear and wolf, is a common marching order
for these splendid pioneers."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One individual instance among the many that
might well be related to add to the annals of human
heroism is the remarkable journey made in 1906
by Constable Sellers, who, with an interpreter and
an Eskimo, drawn by a dog-team, left the west coast
of Hudson Bay in February of that year to discover
the locality of a Scottish ship in the Arctic
waters, to collect the customs due, and to inspect
the conditions of this region.  The trip lasted two
months, and before his return in April Constable
Sellers had experienced all the hardships of an
Arctic winter.  Many pages might be filled with the
thrilling accounts of the adventures and the noble
and self-effacing sacrifices of these brave defenders
of the law, these magnificent protectors of human
life and property, the very guardians of all that
makes for civilisation and lends value and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P308"></a>308}</span>
significance to life.  Mr. Yeigh's description of the
conditions of life of the force on Herschell Island
is extremely graphic.  He says:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The life of the Mounted Policeman on Herschell Island
presents many features of interest.  Stranded in this far-off
corner of the Dominion in the Canadian 'Land of the Midnight
Sun,' he lives as near the North Pole as possible.  It
is a circumscribed island home, moreover, with a shoreline
of only twenty-three miles, and with cliffs rising five hundred
feet from the Arctic Sea.  Though so far north, in latitude
69°, Herschell Island is covered with a luxuriant growth
of grass and carpeted with innumerable wild flowers.  The
island possesses the one safe harbour in all these northern
waters&mdash;a harbour in which fifty ships could safely winter."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This island is distinguished as the centre of the
whaling grounds of the Arctic regions.
</p>

<p>
No adequate interpretation of the conditions that
prevail in the Dominion could be possible that did
not include some account of the "Riders of the
Plains."  The service of these faithful guardians is
by no means exclusively limited to their official
responsibility; they add to this that of being the
friends, the helpers, of the settlers, under all the
new unforeseen conditions that confront them in the
new country.  All over the Canadian land the
watchword "Safety first" meets the eye.  The
watchword "Humanity first" seems to be that of the
Royal Mounted Police.  Their careful and tender
ministrations are given to the invalid and the
helpless; they risk their lives to warn and save
settlers when a raging fire is sweeping over woodlands
or prairie; they aid the new arrival to set up
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P309"></a>309}</span>
his camp the first night; they help him to repair
vehicles or mechanism that has given out; they
assist him to build his first primitive shelter, and
even to cook his meals and to care for his live stock.
The safety of the incoming inhabitants, the essential
conditions that render possible their establishment
of a home, have depended so essentially on the
protection and the safe-guarding afforded by the
"Riders of the Plains" that their splendid service
is not only a fundamental factor in Canadian life
and history, but is a shining page in the records not
made with hands.
</p>

<p>
A touching incident has been narrated in the
chronicles of the Mounted Police Force.  It was
required some years ago to send dispatches to a
distant post during the severest rigour of winter
weather.  A young constable, a University graduate,
gently born and bred, set out with these dispatches,
but days passed into weeks, and weeks into months,
and no trace of him could be discovered.  At last,
in the following spring, a storm-worn uniform and
the bones of a human body were discovered by a
patrol in a secluded spot, and on the order he was
carrying was scrawled: "Lost&mdash;horse dead.  Am
trying to push ahead.  Have done my best."  Who
could read with eyes undimmed by tears such a
testimony as this to the young constable's high sense
of honour and utter sacrifice of anxiety for his own
personal safety?  No soldier at the front ever more
gallantly faced death in the discharge of his duty.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P310"></a>310}</span>
Indeed, the stranger who comes to Canada and
enters with any degree of sympathy and understanding
into the national life is more impressed
with the unwritten watchword of "Duty first"
than with the legend of "safety" that meets his
eye.  Is it too much to say that the Dominion is the
nation of heroes?  It is certainly no exaggeration to
say that heroes abound in this country where the
unmeasured richness of the resources of Nature is
yet far exceeded by the nobility of man's mind.
</p>

<p>
The growth and expansion of Canada has proceeded
very rapidly within the first part of the
twentieth century.  The problems involved in this
swift expansion have increased in number and
importance.  They assume a varied character, because
the vast extent of the empire inevitably raises such
diverse questions of political, educational, and social
requirements, that of the bi-lingual problem being
not least in importance.  Then there are the
problems of immigration, of transportation and
communication, including matters of railway highways,
inland navigation, foreign commerce, and postal
facilities.  Sir James Grant, speaking before the
Empire Club of Toronto in the December of 1915,
reviewed the remarkable development of Canada
since about 1850, and said that, marvellous as was
this record, it would be exceeded by the tremendous
developments of the immediate future.  Of the new
territory in northern Ontario, opened on the clay
belt, Sir James predicted that it would be settled
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P311"></a>311}</span>
by thousands of people, and that it would become
one of the most attractive parts of the country.  In
this region the supply of wood and water is
practically inexhaustible, and the splendid transit
facilities bring it into easy communication with the
markets.  Apart from the agricultural, there is the
mining outlook.
</p>

<p>
Even the great and disastrous war that began
in August, 1914, will not be wholly disastrous, or
even antagonistic, to the future of Canada.  Great
trade facilities will be opened between Russia and
Canada.  Vast numbers of British soldiers who have
left their industrial occupations for the front will
have so accustomed and acclimatised themselves
to open air and exposure that they will look for life
in the open rather than to any return to shops or
manufactories.  Canada confidently anticipates at
least a million settlers from among these ranks.
They would be particularly qualified for the order
of life required for the hardy pioneer of that
North-West defined by Mr. Watson Griffin as lying north
of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British
Columbia, and stretching eastward to Hudson Bay
and northward to the Arctic Ocean.  They would be
prepared to bring to this rigorous and exacting part
of the country a hardy vigour and invincible courage
in the conquering of nature in a degree quite in excess
of that now demanded in the more settled regions.
The young and eminently enterprising western
Provinces have already made the establishment of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P312"></a>312}</span>
Winnipeg as one of the greatest wheat markets in
the world an accomplished fact.  "In 1904," asserts
a New York financial journal, "they raised fifty-eight
million bushels of wheat in Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta; five years later the yield was
one hundred and fifty million bushels, and in 1913
the crop approximated to two hundred millions of
bushels of wheat.  At this rate of progress,"
continued this journal, "Canada must soon pass France
and India, and stand third in the line of wheat
producers.  Ultimately she will dispute with Russia
and the United States for the first position.  Wheat
has been the pioneer of our development, and
undoubtedly it will prove the same with Canada....
No vivid imagination is needed to see what the
future development of Canada means to the people
of the United States."
</p>

<p>
That the great problem of food for the people of
Europe will largely devolve on Canada and the
States for many years after the end of the war is
quite evident.
</p>

<p>
The Minister of Public Works, the Honourable
Robert Rogers, in an interview with a press
representative, said not long ago:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The prairie country will do its share in saving Canada
when the war is over....  There will be a vast tide of
immigration.  Where will the European emigrants go?
Will they go to foreign lands, lands where they will be lost
forever to the Allies, or will they come to Canada, where
they will be under the British flag?  That is the vital
question for Canada, for the Empire, for the Allies, for
civilisation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P313"></a>313}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"We want to be able to go practically to the door of
every European who is thinking of a home elsewhere, and
show him the Canadian West&mdash;tall wheat, ample railway
connections, growing cities and all.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"It will be the finest thing in the world for him and the
satisfaction of Canada.  Moreover, it will be the solution
of most of the problems which now confront him, as, for
instance, how to make our transcontinental railways paying
propositions; how to enable our industries to find new
tasks when the war orders stop; how to adjust our mercantile
system to the changed conditions; how to till our
farm lands and start again the late lamented boom....
</p>

<p class="quote">
"The West is empty.  Its natural resources are inexhaustible.
We could take care of the entire British white
population there.  And think what it would mean for the
West, and so for all Canada, if we got five million new people
out there after the war?  Winnipeg, Brandon, Regina;
Prince Albert, Calgary, Edmonton; Medicine Hat, Portage
la Prairie, Dauphin, Saskatoon, Lethbridge, Swift Current,
and many other centres would become great cities.  The
salubrious British Columbia coast would seethe with new
activity and new populations; our railways would become
great earners; industries would spring up all over the West.
The industries of the East would find a new market within
their own tariff fence.  Banking would boom, wholesale
trade would flourish, young clerks in the East would
become prosperous proprietors in the West."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the eager and many-sided activities that are
springing up and fairly treading upon each other's
heels in Canada, Technical Schools hold a distinctive
place.  The late Lord Strathcona was a zealous
and influential advocate of trade and technical
schools as one of the most effective means of
bettering the condition and elevating the life of the
working-man.  The great West is not behind in the
establishment of these.

<p>
Now as to the conditions that await the settlers in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P314"></a>314}</span>
western Canada.  The land is fertile; the climate,
the water supply, and the transit and traffic facilities
are of the best.  But favourable conditions do not of
themselves work miracles, and pioneer life has its
difficulties.  Prosperity is not magically invoked by
any entreaty of the gods, nor does it fall down out
of the blue sky upon its votaries.  But with health,
integrity, and a reasonable amount of capital, the
achievement of prosperous and happy living is
possible within a comparatively short time.  It is
related that after the annual harvest there are
people who go on pleasure trips to New York and
San Francisco, and "think nothing of expending
thousands of dollars before their return."  There are
farms where the owner has his motor car; his house,
commodious and handsome, is steam-heated and
electric-lighted, as he generates electricity from his
own plant.  There is a music room with a grand
piano, and perchance a violin for the music-gifted
young son or daughter as well; there is a library
with a good and always growing collection of books,
for it is realised that reading is not a mere passive
entertainment but a creative activity as well.  A
good book sets the entire mental mechanism in
motion.  It is as a motor force, a power, applied to
the mind.  To give one's self to intervals of reading
is not merely to be borne through the realms of
thought in a golden chariot, but is, rather, the
conquering of a region of new capabilities and
powers, applicable to the entire range of the problems
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P315"></a>315}</span>
of life.  "The key to every man is his thought,"
says Emerson.  Books are food for the mental and
spiritual life, and from all good reading there results
a certain transubstantiation into energy that refines
and exalts the quality of life.  The broad piazzas,
the shaded lawns, of these prosperous farmhouses
are a revelation to the traveller and their own
commentary on Canadian conditions.
</p>

<p>
Not longer ago than 1900 agriculturalists contended
that wheat could not be grown north of the
fiftieth degree of latitude.  The best quality of the
grain is now raised in the regions north of the
fifty-fifth degree.  All the vast expanse of the Peace
River country, for some 700 miles or more north
of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, offers rich and
attractive soil that well repays cultivation.  As has
been noted in preceding pages, regions that were
formerly supposed to be adapted only to the most
primitive conditions of life&mdash;to hunting, fishing,
canoeing, or dog-sledging&mdash;are now found to be
entirely amenable to ordinary life and pursuits, with
a climate even less rigorous than is sometimes
experienced in the winters of northern Dakota or
Minnesota.  The Japanese chinook wind that blows
in tempers the air, and many of these northern lakes
are now free from ice, for the most part, during the
winter.  This change of the climate has largely been
brought about by the opening up of forests and
dense undergrowth, which so intercepted the sun's
rays that ice would be found at midsummer in the
dense shades.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P316"></a>316}</span>

<p>
The valley of the Athabasca, stretching away
from the portals of Jasper and of Jasper Park, is
an Alpine wonderland; it is enshrined in legendary
history; it is unrivalled in splendour of scenery
and richness of colour; and traversed as it is by
the most modern of our transcontinental lines, it
becomes as easily accessible to tourists as are the
romantic mountain haunts of Colorado.  No more
beautiful summer resort could be dreamed than that
afforded by this valley.  It is destined to become
one of the famous mountain haunts of the world.
Fine carriage roads are being constructed in
Athabasca Valley that will add to the famous drives of
the world, and rank with that never-to-be-forgotten
drive from Sorrento to Amalfi, or that of the
Corniche road on the Riviera.  The Athabasca
Valley and Jasper Park and Mount Robson Park
will be developed into places of great international
resort, as are the Yellowstone Park, the Grand
Canyon in Arizona, and the Yosemite in the United
States.

In the <i>de luxe</i> conditions of travel through all
these regions to-day, it is as difficult to realise the
conditions that prevailed there before the arrival
of the railway line as it was for the little lad at school
to transport himself into the pre-historic days
before the telephone had established its universal
sway.  Reproved by his instructor for not knowing
the date on which Columbus discovered America,
he replied that he could not find it.  "Not find it!"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P317"></a>317}</span>
replied the irate master, "there it is, right before
your eyes, 1492!"  The lad looked at it.  "Why,
I thought that was his telephone number," he
rejoined.  It is quite as difficult for the traveller
to-day to project himself backward, even into the
environment of only a past century.  The world
into which we are born seems to have existed
forever.  It is a curious fact, but one that seems
borne out by experience, that any event which just
preceded one's own consciousness and memory is
practically as remote as if it were many centuries
away.  This truth regarding the phenomena of
consciousness might well enlist the scrutiny of that
analyst of Time and Memory, the brilliant Henri Bergson.
</p>

<p>
Is it amid all the transcendent beauty, all the
scenic glory of the great North-West that one shall
listen for the call and watch for the beckoning to the
Promised Land?  Its prairies and valleys provide
every resource for the support of life, its forests
offer the most incalculable yield in lumber, its lakes
and rivers teem with fish, its mountains are rich in
mineral wealth, it has water power to be utilised
in manufactures, lighting, and traction to an
extent that defies prediction; there is every
contributing cause for great cities to arise, with
universities, with their laboratories and observatories for
science, while, with such a port as that of Prince
Rupert, the commerce of the world will be brought
to these shores; nor does it require any undue effort
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P318"></a>318}</span>
of imagination to see, as in a vision, the libraries,
the conservatories of music, the museums of art
that will arise, the splendour of cities "with room
in their streets for the soul."  The Call of the North-West
is to art, to science, to poetry, to religion.  It is
the call to the great spiritual realities of the spiritualised
life, "the power of conduct, the power of intellect
and knowledge, the power of beauty, and the power
of social life and manners."  The real task of man is
that of the discerner of spiritual truth.  "The universe
is the externalisation of the soul."  And in this
eternal quest man shall press forward "without
haste, without rest," consoled by his divination of
spiritual ideals; a dweller in the atmosphere of
spiritual splendour expressed in those immortal
lines:

Produced by Al Haines
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
